IBM has added a Watson-powered concierge-like service to its helpdesk, and it can quickly solve your IT issues around the clock, wherever you are in the world and whatever device you're using. Unlike automated bots, you can talk to Watson about your issues like you're talking to another person. It can then customize its responses -- for instance, it can use layman's terms if you're not that tech-savvy or use jargons if you are.::::::::It'll solve your problem on the spot if it's something simple like adding storage to an email account, resetting a password or ordering a new company phone or computer. If it's not trained to handle your problem, it'll hand you over to a human IT personnel. However, Watson learns with every interaction and with every feedback it receives and doesn't receive. (It notices if you've chosen not to answer the survey after each chat.) It draws from everything it learns, so after some time, transferring you to its human co-workers might become less and less frequent.::::::::Richard Esposito, IBM's general manager for GTS Mobility Services says: "Today, governments and enterprises need to provide an effective set of capabilities to their workforce, so that their employees can deliver a superior interaction and experience for their citizens and consumers. We need a system that can understand and communicate in a natural language conversation, one that solves problems and continues to learn while engaging with employees. Our Workplace Support Services with Watson delivers this value."
engadget	2017-04-25	ibm_watson_cognitive_photo_booth	https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/25/ibm-watson-cognitive-photo-booth/	Since its introduction to the world in 2009, IBM's Watson supercomputer has been crushing humans in Jeopardy, helping chefs make food with unconventional recipes and even offering tech support. But what happens when the artificial intelligence machine puts its own spin on a photo booth? To find out, I checked out IBM's "Art with Watson: Hidden Portraits," an exhibit that's being displayed in New York City until May 7th. The gallery features portraits of historic personalities like Marie Curie and Nikola Tesla, which Watson helped artists create by feeding them data collected using its natural language and personality insights APIs.::::::::As part of this project, IBM is also showing off the Watson cognitive photo booth. The idea here is for the supercomputer to compose a portrait of you based on five different aspects of your personality: anxiousness, openness, agreeableness, extraversion and conscientiousness. After stepping in the photo booth, Watson asked me a set of questions, such as "Who is your favorite artist and why?" "What did you want to be when you grew up and why?" and "If you could be a movie character for a day, who would it be and why?" Then, it took a picture of me and based on my responses, relying on its speech-to-text and tone analyzer APIs, made a portrait represented by tiny icons of each of my traits.::::::::In the lead image above, for example, the color pink represents my levels of anxiety. According to the supercomputer, my anxiousness was 81 percent, which I can't refute given my unfortunate history of anxiety attacks. Watson also found me to be 88 percent "open," something I definitely agree with since I consider myself quite a transparent and honest individual. When you think about it, it's both impressive and scary that an AI could (sort of) figure me out in just a few minutes, and inside a photo booth of all places. But, somehow, I feel at peace with that, especially since the portrait looks pretty damn good.::::::::If you're in NYC and want to experience it yourself, the Watson cognitive photo booth will be at the Hidden Portraits exhibit at the Cadillac House in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood. As for the rest of you, IBM says it plans to bring it to more places in the future, while an online experience that uses your computer's webcam will also be available in the coming days. The company says this is just another way for people to interact with Watson and see its potential across more serious industries and businesses, including education and the medical field.
engadget	2017-05-03	147_teams_will_compete_for_5_million_in_the_ibm_watson_xprize	https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/03/147-teams-will-compete-for-5-million-in-the-ibm-watson-xprize/	The XPrize program is no stranger to moon shots. From capturing carbon to cleaning water -- even literal trips to the moon and Star Trek-style tricorders -- the contest seeks the boldest solutions to humanity's greatest challenges. That tradition continues in the company's latest competition, the IBM Watson AI XPrize, in which 147 teams from 22 countries will compete for a $5 million purse over the next four years.::::::::The AI competition will be the first such XPrize that is "open" in that teams will be free to solve any issue they want. There will be a number of "domains" (read: themes) that they can choose from including Health and Wellness, Civil Society, Space and Exploration or Energy and Resources, but so long as the competitors solve their problems using AI, their projects can straddle any or all of these domains.::::::::"It's about problem solving," Amir Banifatemi, XPrize's lead for this competition, said in an interview. "For the first time, we're not focusing on one technology. AI is encompassing almost everything so some teams will work with more machine vision, some with natural language processing...there's no limit on the technology that they can use."::::::::The 147 teams already submitted their testing and development plans back on March 1st, 2017. They now have until the start of September to provide evidence that their initial plans will actually work. From there an independent panel of experts will review each team's proposals and announce which of them will be moving on to the next round in January 2018. Teams will be further thinned during additional rounds in 2018 and 2019 before the three finalists present their work at the TED 2020 conference and their projects are voted on by both the in-house audience and those following along online.::::::::Whoever wins will go home with $3 million in prize money, the second place finisher gets a cool million and third place will have earned themselves $500,000. The rest of the $5 million purse will be doled out as $500k "Milestone" prizes for ten teams between 2018 and 2019.
engadget	2017-05-11	ibm_watson_voice_commands_to_star_trek_bridge_crew	https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/11/ibm-watson-voice-commands-to-star-trek-bridge-crew/	Ubisoft's Star Trek: Bridge Crew won't just put you in a VR starship when it finally launches. It'll also give you the power to interact with the virtual Starfleet crew with your voice. The company has teamed up with IBM to add Watson's interactive speech capabilities to the game, so you can tell a crew member to launch a missile -- and maybe even pompously add "make it so" in the end -- instead of using manual controls. Bridge Crew was supposed to launch last year but was plagued with numerous delays. It's now scheduled to come out on May 30th for the PC and PS4, with Watson's voice commands to follow later this summer during a Beta period.::::::::Ubisoft's senior creative director David Votypka Sr. says: "We have been eager to find the right way to use interactive speech further the immersive and interactive experiences that virtual reality offers. Watson gives Captains in Star Trek: Bridge Crew the ability to issue commands to non-player crew members in the same way they do with a human crew; by using their voice. IBM provides an easy to integrate solution that is cloud based, so it's light on code and performance while letting us remain fast on feature turnaround."::::::::While you'll have to wait a few more weeks after the game launches to access voice control, developers can access the feature right now. They can also take advantage of the "VR Speech Sandbox" IBM uploaded to Github, which contains Watson's Unity SDK, Speech to Text and Conversation. It can help them build VR user interfaces with voice interaction and could lead to even more immersive VR games in the future.
venturebeat	2017-02-16	ibm_watson_opens_200_million_iot_headquarters_in_munich	https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/16/ibm-watson-opens-200-million-iot-headquarters-in-munich/	IBM Watson Group opened a $200 million Internet of Things (IoT) headquarters today in Munich, Germany, what the company is calling its biggest investment in Europe in more than two decades.::::::::There more than 1,000 IBM engineers and designers will work with IBM clients and partners in what IBM Watson general manager Harriet Green called a “collaboratory.” Watson works with 6,000 clients worldwide, according to the company.::::::::“This is more than a ribbon cutting or a ceremony. It’s not even a trade show or conference. This is an industry moment. We think it is a turning point because at IBM we have always believed that there is only one way to fill the potential of this truly transformational technology, and that is together,” Green said today at Genius of Things Summit, a gathering of press, the IoT team, and more than 400 business partners.::::::::As part of the opening of the new facility, several partnerships and business deals were announced, including: Visa and IBM Watson will partner to turn wearable and connected devices into points of sale. Free and unlimited use of the Watson IoT platform for startups and entrepreneurs working with Indiegogo and Arrow Electronics crowdfund-to-production service. Bosch will collaborate with IBM Watson to explore industrial IoT opportunities.::::::::Some clients will be a permanent fixture at IBM offices in Munich. BMW employees will work at the new center to place Watson voice control into cars and explore ways to create personalized experiences.::::::::Other companies moving into the 39-story IoT headquarters include connected device maker Avnet, who will work with IBM technologists to make products in an IoT lab. A group of employees from French bank BNP Paribas will move in to work on ways Watson can impact finance.
venturebeat	2017-03-10	10_ways_you_may_have_already_used_ibm_watson	http://venturebeat.com/2017/03/10/10-ways-you-may-have-already-used-ibm-watson/;http://venturebeat.stfi.re/2017/03/10/10-ways-you-may-have-already-used-ibm-watson/?sf=pgxlyxw;http://venturebeat.com/2017/03/10/10-ways-you-may-have-already-used-ibm-watson/?bt_ee=mP7FFHIJMYgapNwIpqzeY29ZmpJfLWFvLlHr1hkRk/IoMceJkIgB9E4wRGJcQZ+U&bt_ts=1489678259203	Watson captured the public imagination about artificial intelligence after defeating two world champions of Jeopardy in 2011 and bringing home a $1 million prize. Since then, Watson has gained new cognitive capabilities through APIs like Alchemy (for sentiment analysis), Tone Analyzer (for personality and emotional analysis), and Conversation (a chatbot builder) and has been embedded in hundreds of applications across financial services, healthcare, retail, and digital.::::::::“Chances are, you’ve interacted with Watson without realizing it,” says Alyssa Simpson, Program Director at IBM Watson. “Many companies hide their use of the technology for competitive reasons. They don’t want a competitor to buy it too.”::::::::However, Simpson did share a number of major brands who are publicly using Watson, ranging from retailers like Macy’s to financial services like H&R Block. Here are 10 companies you might not have realized were using IBM technology.::::::::1. 1-800-Flowers::::::::1-800-Flowers was a launch partner when Facebook first announced their Bots for Messenger platform. While their Facebook chatbot was built by Assist, the company also features a handy virtual assistant named Gwyn who lives on the website and helps you shop for gifts across all of company’s retail brands, including Fruit Bouquets and Popcorn Factory.::::::::2. Macy’s::::::::Most companies struggle to provide consistent, excellent customer service. The struggle is even more real when you’re the largest US department store chain, operating over 700 locations where customers shop for hundreds of thousands of different products. To help address the relentless flow of consumer inquiries, Macy’s leverages Watson to power OnCall, a support bot currently live at several store locations.::::::::3. H&R Block::::::::“I love doing taxes,” said no one ever, not even tax preparers. To streamline the process, H&R Block integrated Watson to improve client communications, identify deduction opportunities, and optimize your filing strategy. Unlike a human, Watson can analyze all 74,000 pages of tax code, keep up with changes in the law, and calculate the best approach for saving money.::::::::4. Staples::::::::Constantly re-ordering office supplies for your team is not fun, which is why Staples invented their recognizable red Easy button. Install this button in your office and simply say “Order me more blue pens” and Watson will process your spoken input and get your order under way.::::::::5. Autodesk::::::::Customer support tickets cost companies a few dollars apiece to tackle, which adds up when you have hundreds of thousands of customers or more. Even simple support requests, such as switching account information, can be costly when fielded by human experts. By building a customer support bot named Ava with Watson technologies, Autodesk was able to reduce support costs by 90% and resolve issues in minutes and not hours.::::::::6. Chevrolet::::::::Chevrolet’s “Find New Roads” campaign is all about promoting positivity and creative thinking when confronted with challenges. In fact, the brand decided to reward positive consumers by teaming up with Watson to analyze Facebook or Twitter posts and reward the most positive people with free gas.::::::::7. The North Face::::::::When it comes to shopping, one size does NOT fit all, but trying to find the perfect fit for your specific needs can be daunting when you’re culling through hundreds of options. Partnering with Watson, the North Face is driving forward “cognitive retail” which matches you automatically to the appropriate options based on a quick survey about your intended usage. No longer do you have to decide whether you need a jacket with synthetic, down, or cotton insulation. Just outsource the decisions to Watson.::::::::8. TD Ameritrade::::::::Personal finance and investments can be confusing. Alvi, a bot powered by Watson, matches you to the right investment education by learning about your personality. You can speak to Alvi directly and answer a few personal questions, ask Alvi to deduce your personality by analyzing your social media accounts, or simply pick from four main investor profiles: Cautious Optimist, Trend Spotter, Advice Seeker, and Researcher.::::::::9. Rare Carat::::::::The average cost of an engagement ring is well over $4,000, so you do not want to buy the wrong one. While simple options like color and shape might be easy to decide on, you might be confused by how to evaluate qualities like “fluorescence” or certification method. Luckily, Rocky, a handy bot that lives on the Rare Carat website, leverages Watson to guide you in your important purchasing decision.::::::::10. The Weather Company::::::::As the fourth most-used mobile app in the United States, the Weather Company was an attractive acquisition target for IBM, which bought them in October 2015. Having a popular consumer app has enabled IBM to launch Watson Ads, an interactive ad unit that allows consumers to chat with branded content via voice or text. Brands like Toyota, Campbell Soup Company, and Unilever have already jumped on board.::::::::Many more companies use Watson, including Health&, Volume, OmniEarth, Roztayger, and Head Racquet. IBM even uses Watson internally to augment human tech support for their developer tools.
venturebeat	2017-03-19	playfab_taps_ibms_watson_ai_for_deeper_insights_into_gamer_behavior	http://venturebeat.com/2017/03/19/playfab-taps-ibms-watson-ai-for-deeper-insights-into-gamer-behavior/	IBM and PlayFab are teaming up to deliver better insights about gamers based on analysis from IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence platform.::::::::Seattle-based PlayFab provides backend services for connected games on mobile devices and PCs. It provides things game developers need to run their games — like player data storage, player relationship management, tournaments, in-game commerce, and leaderboards. IBM will take that data, crunch it, and come up with insights that help developers run their games better. It’s a new way for IBM to participate in what market researcher Newzoo says is a $91 billion market.::::::::PlayFab, founded in 2014, already has more than 600 live games, with 45 million monthly players and 2.9 billion game sessions. Atari’s Rollercoaster Tycoon Touch launched on Android last week using PlayFab’s platform. About another 1,000 titles are in development on PlayFab’s platform, which runs on top of Amazon Web Services. IBM is making the announcement on stage at its Interconnect event in Las Vegas.::::::::“We are starting to see much more traction than even six months ago,” said James Gwertzman, CEO of PlayFab, in an interview with GamesBeat. “It’s a backend solution they don’t have to write themselves.”::::::::But the business is shifting, and PlayFab is being used not just for the backend service but for other tasks as well.::::::::“The biggest shift in how I think about PlayFab in the past year is that we were a backend technology,” Gwertzman said. “We still have that, but we have shifted to live operations, providing tools and services for operating games after the launch.”::::::::That’s where IBM’s Watson, best known as the supercomputer AI that beat the world’s best human Jeopardy player in 2011, comes in through a joint marketing agreement. PlayFab will provide game data to IBM’s Watson Data Platform on the IBM Cloud. Watson will analyze the data and send insights back to PlayFab to provide to its customers. That will unlock new insights and value for game developers. It will, for instance, come up with suggestions for how to keep players more engaged in real time.::::::::“A lot of live ops teams have had to make due with whatever they could hack together,” Gwertzman said. “Live ops is becoming a creative part of the game process. At PlayFab, we are not advanced data scientists ourselves. Watson can do pretty hardcore data science.”::::::::With Watson, IBM has natural language data processing. Developers can use natural language queries to do things like glean the general mood of aggregated game reviews.::::::::The Watson Data Platform provides game developers with the necessary tools to perform deep, collaborative analytics, including machine learning, across massive data sets. With Watson Machine Learning, game developers can analyze more data about their players and deploy those learnings directly into their games via PlayFab’s platform.::::::::Atari is one of the first publishers to leverage this new partnership between IBM and PlayFab.::::::::“Understanding what players experience and being able to react quickly has become crucial to success in operating a modern game,” said Sylvain Constantin, executive producer for Roller Coaster Tycoon Touch, in a statement. “This is why we are so excited to now be collaborating with IBM, through their relationship with PlayFab. The Watson Data Platform takes us to a whole new level of power and capabilities.”::::::::Additionally, the Watson Data Platform provides PlayFab developers the ability to accelerate and simplify data ingestion — up to 43 terabytes per hour — then collaborate around the data with a wide range of analytics tools including a variety of machine learning libraries. The Watson Data Platform brings together content, data, models, and open source resources from IBM and others — including H2O, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebooks on Apache Spark — in a single, secure managed environment.::::::::“As the mobile gaming industry has really [taken] off in recent years, there is a tremendous amount of data that needs analysis,” said Derek Schoettle, general manager of the Watson Data Platform, in a statement. “IBM Watson Data Platform applies the built-for-data architecture of IBM Cloud and the power of cognitive technology to help game developers unlock insights from their data faster and deploy it quicker to provide new experiences and stickier engagement.”::::::::PlayFab has 14 employees and is funded by Benchmark, Madrona Venture Group, and marquee angel investors.
venturebeat	2017-03-27	intel_just_painted_a_target_on_ibm_watsons_back	https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/27/intel-just-painted-a-target-on-ibm-watsons-back/	Intel announced late last week that it has formed a new AI group to consolidate a number of its programs and acquisitions. It’s headed by Naveen Rao, the former head of Intel acquisition Nervana. This means Intel is making sure is has a major seat at the table as artificial intelligence and machine learning branch out to touch virtually everything — from autonomous driving to IoT to enhancing corporate systems — over the next 5-7 years.::::::::In the short term, the group will focus on research related to its software and hardware (Nervana, Xeon/Lakecrest chips and subsequent families) to deliver AI for drones and autonomous vehicles, smart cities, health care, personal appliances, etc. But I expect a longer-term play. Intel will be putting together a complete set of products to bring to traditional manufacturers in its chip business across the full breadth of edge computing to big data center platforms for things like Xeon Phi based AI solutions that power financial models, biological research/modeling, and scientific research. For example, plans for Intel’s Mobileye and Nervana acquisitions will fall under this group’s charter. Mobileye is known as an enabler of vision for cars and drones, but its vision based models, together with AI and ML could prove highly valuable in fields like security, visual analysis of health-related issues, and real-time forecasting.::::::::Additional technologies like Saffron (with its AI-as-a-Service model), which Intel acquired in 2015, have already started to give the Intel visibility into customer needs, enabling it to learn about future requirements and experiment on solutions. Nervana gives Intel the ability to experiment with optimized architectures in addition to Xeon Phy massively parallel processing systems that will power next generation AI systems. And Intel’s close alliance with the research and open source communities gives it the ability to learn as well as influence future directions in AI/ML. But the company will also deploy customized solutions through its consulting services and will eventually offer these as off-the-shelf enterprise cognitive computing toolsets for verticals like financial modeling, genetic research, transportation best routing, etc. The ultimate target: compete head to head with IBM Watson in particular and other up and coming solutions in general.::::::::IBM is on a different path. In the current early phase of the emerging AI market, IBM has a lot of momentum. It has signed agreements with high profile companies (a partnership with Salesforce, for example) and acquired its own stable of AI related properties (such as Weather.com). IBM is investing heavily in Watson and related service offerings and has devoted substantial resources to make it successful. It’s highly likely IBM will be making additional acquisitions in this space over the coming 1-2 years. IBM considers Watson its primary general purpose platform for AI, much as it did with Websphere for web services, and is building on top of this platform with customized solutions through its service organization and through partnerships. And it will acquire complementary technology as required.::::::::But Intel thinks IBM has a distinct challenge that it can exploit. Watson is taking a wide approach to cognitive computing by trying to do everything for everyone. It does have some vertically focused solutions, but IBM, as it has in the past with other products, is positioning Watson as a general purpose capability. This is a difficult road to take. Intel’s more focused approach could ultimately prove more successful. By looking for specific needs and “templates” to make neural networks do specific things that are then optimized for its hardware assets, Intel thinks it can beat the other contenders with targeted solutions fully optimized for specific markets and tasks.::::::::Intel is leveraging standards and open source tools rather than developing proprietary solutions. It’s working with Tensorflow, the open source ML library developed by Google, and Neon, the open source deep learning language and library based on Python, which will be optimized for Intel hardware but remain open sourced. Indeed, Neon even runs on GPUs from Nvidia, a key rival. Intel is offering some of its own innovations to the open source community and is building relationships with key players like Google and Microsoft. This is much more aligned with Intel’s past experiences and business practices and should provide it with a model it can comfortably implement.::::::::I expect Intel to make a number of additional acquisitions over the next couple of years in this rapidly evolving market. A piece-meal approach to specific problems is actually more in line with most business needs. Intel looks for targeted vertical solutions to solve defined business challenges rather than deploying broad-based systems. And it can productize these targeted offerings to be used by partners/solutions providers — its traditional channel.::::::::The new Intel AI group has maximum focus as it reports directly to CEO Brian Krzanich. There is no doubt this group is critical to Intel’s future and will be a major revenue generator in the next 3-5 years. AI can touch nearly every product line, merging with existing capabilities to move to the next step incrementally. But it’s hard to fully comprehend what computing architectures are needed for AI. Taking standard CPU and GPU computer architecture and shoe horning them for AI may not be enough, which is why Intel has acquired technology like Nervana chip architectures due out this year. Intel has also made a Cloudera investment, looking to roll that into Xeon chips and other big data capabilities in the future. Where the architectures go over the next few years is still unknown but could be very compelling.::::::::Bottom line: with this commitment, Intel is clearly signaling it does not intend to be left behind in AI. In fact, it expects that, with its extensive resources, it can be both a major implementer of new technologies/research, as well as a key contributor to better market understanding, which will give it a leg up in knowing what’s needed to power the next generation of its computing systems and reshape its business longer term.::::::::Intel has laid down the challenge, and AI-focused solutions companies like IBM Watson and hardware companies like Nvidia should take heed.
venturebeat	2017-04-04	ibm_watson_ai_will_help_spot_great_shots_at_the_masters_golf_tournament	https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/04/ibm-watson-ai-will-help-spot-great-shots-at-the-masters-golf-tournament/	It isn’t easy to capture the best shots in a golf tournament that is being televised. And that’s why IBM is applying the artificial intelligence of its Watson platform to the task of identifying the best shots at The Masters golf tournament.::::::::For the first time at a sporting event, IBM is harnessing Watson’s ability to see, hear, and learn to identify great shots based on crowd noise, player gestures, and other indicators. IBM Watson will create its own highlight reels.::::::::With 90 golfers playing multiple rounds over four days, video from every tee, every hole, and multiple camera angles can quickly add up to thousands of hours of footage.::::::::IBM Research and IBM iX developed a Cognitive Highlights application to auto-curate individual shot highlights from live video streams. This helps simplify and accelerate the video production process for highlight packages. The system can detect a  player celebrating or the start of a golf swing.::::::::And this is just the foundation on which IBM will be able to create unique content for personalized experiences for producers, media, and, eventually, fans. This is also the foundation for myriad possible solutions in machine vision and hearing that can be applied to challenges across other industries.::::::::Media and entertainment is one example where this technology could be useful. Imagine how much this would help a TV broadcast producer work at scale. Watson can advise the producer and give them a baseline highlight package from which to work.::::::::The first Watson Highlights dashboard will be onsite for viewing at the Masters. This won’t factor into the actual TV broadcast for 2017, but highlights will be part of the Masters apps and should be available to share on social media.::::::::By leveraging TV graphics and optical character recognition (OCR), the system automatically gathers information about the player name, along with the hole number. This metadata is then associated with the detected highlight segments and posted to a dashboard. In the future, this will enable searches like “show me all highlights of player X during the tournament” or be used to create personalized highlights compilations based on favorite players.::::::::IBM is also rolling out a “cognitive room” at the media center in Augusta, where media will be able to experience all that IBM is doing behind the scenes at the Masters, including what goes into the apps and the ability to voice-interact with the video screen walls (powered by Watson) to generate on-demand player stats and highlights.
venturebeat	2017-05-09	ibm_watson_to_help_pebble_beach_create_a_virtual_concierge_for_guests	https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/09/ibm-watson-to-help-pebble-beach-create-a-virtual-concierge-for-guests/	Watson, where did I hit my golf ball?::::::::IBM and the Pebble Beach Company have partnered to add Watson’s artificial intelligence to a virtual concierge that shows guests around the Pebble Beach golf resort.::::::::The collaboration highlights how IBM is targeting the golf business and virtual concierge experiences with its AI technology. IBM also partnered with The Masters golf tournament to use AI to spot great shots, and it used Watson at the U.S. Tennis Open. Pebble Beach is launching a new app that uses the intelligence of Watson — the supercomputing technology that beat the world’s best human Jeopardy player — to guide people around the resort. All told, IBM is targeting its Watson Cognitive Computing technology at 20 different industries.::::::::To promote the app, the companies have tapped star surfer Laird Hamilton and pro volleyball player Gabrielle Reece. While Intel is targeting its technologies at active sports and extreme sports, IBM is going after the golfing set, which has a lot of money to spend.::::::::The app is embedded with Watson’s Conversation applications programming interface (API), which enables visitors to experience Pebble Beach as if they’re traveling with a local guide.::::::::“We’re pleased to bring the cognitive power of Watson to Pebble Beach through our new app, which will enhance our guest experience whether they are here to explore 17-Mile Drive or to enjoy our award-winning restaurants and shops,” said Bill Perocchi, CEO of Pebble Beach Company, in a statement. “IBM combines industry expertise and cutting-edge technology to deliver a level of engagement our guests haven’t seen before, making the company a great fit in our portfolio of brand partners. This new app will provide a new, transformative way for our guests to enjoy their Pebble Beach experience.”::::::::Available for download on iOS and Android devices, the mobile app, designed by IBM iX, is hosted on the IBM Cloud and includes the virtual concierge, through which guests can use voice queries to discover the dining and shopping options at Pebble Beach.::::::::By tapping into the Watson Conversation API, the app can provide answers to requests such as, “Where can I get a burger?” or “I need a souvenir for my daughter.” The technology uses frame-based dialogues, where several options are presented, rather than the command-and-response seen in other machine learning technology.::::::::The app also gives guests a full tour of the 17-Mile route on the California coast, and it can create an express tour for guests who want all the highlights in a shorter time frame.::::::::Guests can use the app to create a 60-second souvenir movie of their Pebble Beach experience, using their own photos, then instantly share it on social networks. They can use an interactive resort guide to discover dining, shopping, and scenic options at Pebble Beach.::::::::They can browse points of interest by category or tap around the map to read menus, make reservations, and get directions to favorite locations around the resort. And the “today at Pebble Beach” feature gives guests information about daily events happening across the resort and allows them to set calendar reminders.::::::::“IBM’s work with Pebble Beach Company is a powerful example of how companies are infusing Watson’s cognitive technologies into the lives of consumers and helping enhance the customer experience at the iconic resort,” said Noah Syken, a vice president for the sports and entertainment sponsorships at IBM, in a statement. “Pebble Beach is focused on making its customer interactions even more personal and valuable with the help of Watson. This partnership is reimagining the customer experience, bringing the sights and sounds of 17-Mile Drive to life.”IBM is also deploying analytics to help the Pebble Beach Company run the resort with smarter and quicker data analysis.::::::::Artificial intelligence has become the buzzword du jour.  At Google’s I/O 2017, the company announced its slogan change from “Mobile First” to “AI First,” fueling the frenzy. VCs, startups, and established companies alike are all getting into the gold rush of AI. But what is AI, anyway?::::::::First, what AI is not: AI is not one single technology.  AI is made up of multiple technologies. The technologies under the AI umbrella are at varying stages of maturity — and promise — when we think about broader business application. The two getting the most attention at the moment are machine learning and deep learning. Think of these as smaller subsets of each other, with artificial intelligence being the umbrella, machine learning being a subset of that, and deep learning again a subset of machine learning. Advancements in deep learning (which employs neural networks to “learn”) the past few years has sparked the most excitement in the industry and also shows the most promise.::::::::Second, AI is not a single industry, but rather a layered industry comprising a data layer, a statistical layer where models are built, and a business application layer. When a startup says it is an “AI company,” it’s helpful to understand which layer they operate in because one layer alone may not give you what you need.::::::::So, what is AI?::::::::At the heart of it, applied AI is about patterns and predictions. It’s how computational machines can recognize images, texts, speech — essentially large sets of structured or unstructured data — to determine patterns and consequently make predictions. What is the likelihood this customer will purchase a car after buying a new home? Could this MRI image show malignant cancer? Is this credit card charge a fraudulent transaction? These are some of the types of predictions borne out of AI technological applications.::::::::The underlying technologies include natural language processing, image recognition, speech recognition, computer vision, and much more. The core of these technologies is the ability of the computer to “understand” something, whether text, speech, or image, and deliver a task or output.::::::::AI has been around for more than 50 years, but the advent of stronger computing power and the availability of vast amounts of data has enabled a breakthrough in artificially intelligent offerings. From Deep Mind’s AlphaGo beating legendary Go player Ke Jie to Amazon’s Alexa advancements recently, the developments in the past three years have been revolutionary.::::::::Digital transformation bears fruit.::::::::Companies want to cash in on the gold rush, but what are the building blocks that allow a company to be AI-ready or, at the very least, AI-capable? Any non-digitally native company has several steps to take before capitalizing on the next wave of artificial intelligence application, the most important being its digital transformation.::::::::When a company embarks on a digital transformation, it migrates from an analog world to a digital one, where transactions and information are digitized. A full end-to-end digital transformation also includes upgraded technological capabilities, such as cloud migration and re-imagined processes that allow better agility and access. The digitized data becomes an asset that allows models to be built that then predict a desired outcome. The vaster the amount of digitized data a company has, the better its ability to predict an outcome. The more technological capabilities a company has, the shorter the cycle times, which enables faster learning.::::::::This can be illustrated further by the virtuous cycle of data enabling product: Having users or customers that provide data allows that data to inform better product development. Better product development means a better product that then attracts more users. And so the cycle continues, and the snowball grows.::::::::Successful AI deployments::::::::What are some use cases of businesses deploying AI today? Some of the more popular ones I’ve seen are the deployment of chatbot technology. Capital One, a leading financial service provider in the U.S., rolled out Eno (“One” spelled in reverse), a bot that is NLP capable, allowing the use of SMS as an interface.::::::::Capital One also launched account access through Amazon’s Alexa platform, allowing users to perform a variety of tasks like bill pay, balanced review, and a host of other voice-based transactions.::::::::Stripe, a unicorn in the payments space, launched Radar, its anti-fraud product that uses machine learning to detect aberrant behavior. Machine learning is particularly useful in risk management, as well as fraud.::::::::The examples of AI application across verticals and functions are too numerous to list here, but this gives a flavor of what is possible.::::::::Steps to effective AI integration.::::::::So, in the hopes of staying on the frontier, what can a company do? What are the steps we need to take to be ready for the next curve?::::::::1. First things first, review your digital transformation roadmap. How has your business model shifted to align towards the customer, and how have your systems aligned towards data as an asset? Digital transformation is truly foundational to any type of AI adoption in the future.::::::::2. Next, educate yourself and your executive leadership team. How well do you understand AI?::::::::3. Develop your AI strategy. What’s your endgame? In-house or outsourced? Watson, Salesforce, startups? This can take on so many forms.::::::::4. Review your organizational readiness and team capabilities. Do you have the right talent, or are you just shifting resources within your team? Are you keeping your engineers trained on the latest techniques and tools? Do you have a Python developer, NLP statistician, and so on? Is strategic data acquisition a need? Do you have a central data warehouse?::::::::5. View your end-to-end process. How ready are you to develop and deploy AI?::::::::6. Discuss legal and ethical issues at the beginning. While I believe fears of superhuman intelligence are unfounded today, there should be guidelines to ensure the transparency of model development and any automated processes that can adversely impact the customer.::::::::How do you see AI playing a role in your company’s digital transformation?

This feature is part of a strategic partnership with Ubisoft. I recently tried out the game and found it to be a lot of fun to play with human strangers. I’m curious if Watson will answer in various actors’ voices, like Mr. Spock.::::::::“We have been eager to find the right way to use interactive speech further the immersive and interactive experiences that virtual reality offers,” said David Votypka, senior creative director at Red Storm Entertainment, a Ubisoft Studio, in a statement. “Watson gives Captains in Star Trek: Bridge Crew the ability to issue commands to non-player crew members in the same way they do with a human crew; by using their voice. IBM provides an easy to integrate solution that is cloud based, so it’s light on code and performance while letting us remain fast on feature turnaround.”::::::::IBM’s new “VR Speech Sandbox,” the software used to build the Star Trek: Bridge Crew feature, is now available for all developers to adapt for their own VR applications and services. The Sandbox combines IBM’s Watson Unity software development kit with two services, Watson Speech to Text and Watson Conversation. Developers now have the opportunity to build new and innovative user interfaces, leveraging the power of voice interaction in virtual reality.::::::::In-game speech experiences, built with IBM Watson for Star Trek: Bridge Crew will be available this summer in beta testing for cross-platform play. The Watson and Star Trek: Bridge Crew experience will allow players to give direct, interactive speech commands to virtual Starfleet shipmates. By infusing this new cognitive technology into the game, players will be able to seamlessly complete missions online, with both AI characters and human partners, without breaking immersion.::::::::“For the first time, Watson will power the technology that makes it possible for gamers and fans of Star Trek to interact with the crew,” said Willie Tejada, chief developer advocate at IBM, in a statement. “We are only just seeing the impact of virtual and augmented reality and IBM is committed to providing developers with the tools they need to innovate and be competitive in this AI and Cognitive era.”

As part of the partnership, IBM has signed a deal to deploy the Salesforce Service Cloud for internal use there. The value of the deal and proposed pricing of the joint products were not disclosed.::::::::The deal has several parts. Among the most notable:::::::::IBM Watson APIs will be integrated into Salesforce. This means that companies using Salesforce will more easily be able to ingest information from IBM's Watson artificial intelligence platform, such as weather or local shopping patterns, according to the companies.::::::::The Weather Company, which IBM acquired in 2015, will provide a new component on the Salesforce AppExchange so that Salesforce customers can pull weather data more easily into their apps.::::::::Bluewolf, an IBM-owned consulting company, will offer a new practice to help customers combine IBM Watson with Salesforce's own artificial intellligence capabilities known as Einstein.::::::::Both companies, like many others in the tech industry, are making investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, by which computer programs attempt to connect data in new ways to provide new kinds of insights and assistance to users, and both frequently cite the importance of AI in their sales pitches to customers.::::::::IBM Watson suffered some bad publicity in February, however, when University of Texas auditors released a scathing report on a high-profile project involving Watson at MD Anderson hospital and placed the project on hold, although they cautioned that the decision "should not be interpreted as an opinion on the scientific basis or functional capabilities of the system in its current state."

Watson.::::::::"I think what IBM is excellent at is using their sales and marketing infrastructure to convince people who have asymmetrically less knowledge to pay for something," Palihapitiya added. "I put them and Oracle in somewhat of the same bucket."::::::::IBM responded to Palihapitiya's comments early Tuesday.::::::::"Watson is not a consumer gadget but the A.I. platform for real business. Watson is in clinical use in the U.S. and 5 other countries. It has been trained on 6 types of cancers with plans to add 8 more this year," the company said in a statement. "Beyond oncology, Watson is in use by nearly half of the top 25 life sciences companies, major manufacturers for IoT applications, retail and financial services firms, and partners like GM, H&R Block and SalesForce.com. Does any serious person consider saving lives, enhancing customer service and driving business innovation a joke?"::::::::When it comes to investing in tech companies, Palihapitiya believes people should bet on the CEOs like Tesla's Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, rather than the company's business model.::::::::"At the end of the day, when you are making deep methodical investments in technology companies, it is fundamentally first and foremost about the jockey," he said.::::::::In fact, Musk "is probably the closest thing to Thomas Edison we have in our generation," Palihapitiya added.::::::::He recommended Tesla's convertible bonds at the 22nd annual Sohn Conference, pointing out that it was effectively like buying the equity but with the downside protection of a bond.::::::::At last year's Sohn Conference, Palihapitiya recommended Amazon, whose stock is up 40 percent in the past year.

Watson is in clinical use in the U.S. and 5 other countries. It has been trained on 6 types of cancers with plans to add 8 more this year," the company said in a statement.

Does any serious person consider saving lives, enhancing customer service and driving business innovation a joke?"::::::::Palihapitiya said he would never invest in IBM. "I'm in the business of buying things that can grow in meaningful multiples ... over five to 10 year periods." But on the positive side, he said, "That's a business that I think can generate an enormous amounts of cash. I think they'll acquire aggressively."

IBM 0.07% and Salesforce.com Inc. CRM 0.46% agreed to mingle their artificial-intelligence technologies in a bid to boost sales of data-analytics offerings.::::::::The companies Monday announced plans to offer integrated AI services that weave the broad human-like conversation and learning capabilities of IBM’s Watson with Salesforce’s more sales-oriented Einstein technology. The new offerings, available in the second half of the year, are aimed at helping a wide variety of companies better target products and services at customers.::::::::The agreement is IBM’s latest move to put Watson in front of a broad business audience. The company has tailored its artificial-intelligence system, a linchpin of its effort to reinvent itself for the cloud-computing era, for a variety of industries including health care, financial services and automobiles. The Salesforce deal potentially could make the system available to any company with a sales team.::::::::For Salesforce, the deal adds IBM’s broader AI capabilities to its products as it faces increasing competition from tech powerhouses such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. As part of the deal, IBM agreed to use Salesforce’s customer-service software companywide, giving Salesforce a marquee customer.::::::::IBM and Salesforce aren’t sharing revenue, but rather plan to continue selling their AI services independently. The bet is both companies will reach more customers as those capabilities work together than they would have separately.::::::::Einstein is designed to understand information collected by Salesforce’s customers that fits neatly into specific categories, such as the number of purchases a specific customer has made.::::::::Watson specializes in interpreting information that hasn’t been categorized, such as the text of research papers or social-media posts. Much of that information comes from public sources, as well as from data sources IBM has purchased. Its capabilities are largely available as a set of cloud services customers can program into their own software.::::::::Together, for example, Watson could weave predictions about local buying patterns with Einstein’s customer-specific data about shopping preferences. That could help retailers automatically send highly personalized and localized email campaigns to shoppers, the companies said.::::::::Finnish elevator maker Kone Oyj already is using the combined AI service, IBM and Salesforce said. Kone uses Watson to monitor the status of its elevators, and uses Salesforce Service Cloud to provide customer-service functions. Combining the services could help Kone customers repair elevators more quickly, or even detect and resolve potential problems before they emerge.::::::::“The real value is when you link these processes together, not just apply AI to an individual one,” IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty said.::::::::IBM already had a relationship with Salesforce through Bluewolf Group, a consulting service specializing in Salesforce’s services IBM bought in 2016. That acquisition led to the AI partnership between the companies, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said.
wsj	2017-03-08	hospital_stumbles_in_bid_to_teach_a_computer_to_treat_cancer	https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospital-stumbles-in-bid-to-teach-a-computer-to-treat-cancer-1488969011	In 2012, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center launched an ambitious project with International Business Machines Corp.’s IBM 0.07% Watson program that promised to transform cancer care with the help of artificial intelligence.::::::::Almost five years and more than $62 million later, the sprawling Houston-based public institution has little to show for it, according to a special review conducted by the University of Texas System Audit Office that details a number of stumbles in the progress and management of the project.::::::::The audit doesn’t evaluate IBM Watson’s scientific capabilities or whether the technology works for this purpose.::::::::Instead, the report details the management and technology challenges at MD Anderson that make it hard to integrate artificial-intelligence software into complicated health-care settings. The Watson-based program isn't in clinical use, according to the audit.::::::::The plan for a pilot focused on leukemia was “suspended mid-project” and the focus shifted to lung cancer to try to speed up progress, according to audit documents.::::::::Clinical trial and drug-protocol data in the system are outdated, and the pilot program doesn’t work with the hospital’s current electronic health records, according to the audit.::::::::Oncology Expert Advisor, or OEA, is the Watson-based intelligent system IBM was building for MD Anderson. Watson, the Jeopardy-playing artificial-intelligence software, learns patterns from data and uses that knowledge to make suggestions. The new system was supposed to read and learn from MD Anderson’s electronic medical records, academic literature, research data and treatment options to improve cancer care at the renowned cancer center.::::::::An IBM spokeswoman said the “pilot was a success, and likely could have been taken forward had MD Anderson chosen to do so.” The report noted that the system “is not ready” for testing on humans or for “clinical use” because the data used to run it is “outdated.”::::::::On Wednesday, MD Anderson’s president, Ronald DePinho, resigned. The timing of his departure is still being worked out, the hospital said.::::::::“It became clear to me that this great and noble institution needs a new president who will inspire greater unity and sharp operational focus,” he said in a video message to staff.::::::::During his five-year tenure as president, the hospital was embroiled in several problems—including layoffs, losses in productivity due to a transition to a new medical-record system and internal questions over how the OEA contracts were procured, which culminated in the audit.::::::::Lynda Chin, the former chair of genomic medicine at MD Anderson, approached IBM about using Watson to upgrade cancer care at the hospital, according to the audit. Dr. Chin is married to Dr. DePinho. In June 2012, the two organizations signed their first contract for $2.4 million.::::::::Since then, the contract has been renewed a dozen times, totaling $39 million in fees paid by MD Anderson, according to the audit. The lung-cancer system pilot within MD Anderson achieved an accuracy of 90% in its predictions, according to staff member interviews cited in the audit.::::::::The figure refers to the system’s success rate at suggesting the same treatment plan as MD Anderson physicians on select cases, based on its reading of relevant information in patient charts, said Rob Merkel, general manager for oncology and genomics at IBM Watson Health, an IBM division focused on health care.::::::::The system was tested in 2015 and supported “treatment recommendations as well as clinical-trial matching,” according to an IBM spokeswoman. The vision was also to make the tool widely available to physicians at partner hospitals outside MD Anderson, according to the audit.::::::::University of Texas Chancellor William McRaven ordered an audit of the project after MD Anderson’s audit and compliances offices expressed concerns in May last year about whether the project was delivering on contracted services, such as piloting OEA at partner hospitals and whether project leaders followed appropriate procurement requirements, according to university spokeswoman Karen Adler and the audit.::::::::MD Anderson hired an external firm to conduct a separate audit to evaluate the market for and value of the artificial intelligence system, Ms. Adler said.::::::::Mr. Merkel of IBM Watson Health, in response to the concerns raised in the audit, said the focus was switched from leukemia because the project at the time was in an “evaluation phase.” He also added IBM “wasn’t responsible” for integrating Watson with MD Anderson’s new electronic medical records. MD Anderson didn’t specify who was responsible for the integration.::::::::In addition to the management and technology issues, the audit found the program was never piloted with partner hospitals as stipulated in a contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was also hired to craft a business plan for the system. MD Anderson paid PwC $23 million in total for various services associated with the project.::::::::IBM stopped supporting the technology in September, according to the report. IBM declined to comment on the status of the project. PwC also declined to comment.::::::::In the audit, Dr. Chin cited cybersecurity reviews and “lack of engagement or interest” by partner hospitals as factors preventing testing the technology outside MD Anderson, as stipulated in the PwC contract. A spokeswoman said Dr. Chin wasn’t available for an interview.Medical institutions often struggle to bring all data on to the same platform, said Peter Szolovits, the head of the Clinical Decision-Making Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The way medical information is stored and labeled can differ widely, even between departments at the same institution, he said.::::::::For instance, “there’s no standard way to record a heart rate, a blood-glucose value or temperature measured at the bedside,” he said.::::::::If the way data is stored or labeled changes, often the artificial-intelligence software must be retrained, he said.::::::::At MD Anderson, the lung-cancer pilot, for instance, was conducted on the hospital’s old electronic records system.::::::::It needs to be integrated with the new system before the program can be tested further, the audit said. MD Anderson hasn’t given up on its original intent.::::::::In January, it sent out a request for proposals for another software system to use artificial intelligence in cancer, according to its public bids page. Previous vendors can also bid, the hospital said.::::::::John Kelly III, senior vice president of cognitive solutions and IBM Research, the tech company’s research-and-development unit, said the Watson system was “all set to go.” He added that it would only take “months to get it up and running” if MD Anderson gave IBM “the green light.”::::::::IBM declined to say if it had bid on the project, the deadline for which ended last month.

IBM 0.07% on Tuesday reported a 13% drop in quarterly earnings and narrower profit margins across its business units, including divisions that manage the cloud computing and Watson artificial intelligence operations that the technology giant is banking on to transform its business.::::::::IBM’s revenue in the first three months of the year fell from the same period a year ago for the 20th consecutive quarter, with cognitive solutions the only one of its five major divisions to report improving its standing marginally from a year ago.::::::::The Armonk, N.Y., company’s shares fell 4.1% in after-hours trading. Shares closed Tuesday down 0.6% in regular trading to $170.05.::::::::Martin Schroeter, IBM’s chief financial officer, attributed the net profit decline to a one-time tax benefit that had lifted prior-year results. Pre-tax income rose 38% in the first quarter to $1.4 billion.::::::::However, a silver lining for IBM—revenue from the faster-growing, higher-margin businesses it calls “strategic imperatives”—rose 12% from a year ago to $7.8 billion.::::::::IBM’s legacy businesses selling hardware, software, and services for traditional corporate computing facilities have been shrinking as customers embrace cloud computing and big-data analytics. The company has been building new revenue streams in its strategic-imperatives businesses including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, security, and mobile technology.::::::::For instance, its Watson artificial intelligence platform offers software designed to understand and act on dynamics of specific industries, such as health care and finance, as well as commands and functions that software developers can use to stitch artificial intelligence into their programs.::::::::Revenue from the strategic-imperatives businesses is spread out among several units. For instance, cloud revenue, which IBM said was $14.6 billion over the past 12 months, comes from all divisions, not just the Technology Services & Cloud Platforms unit that oversees cloud operations.::::::::IBM executives lately have put increasing emphasis on so-called public cloud computing services, which are shared among customers rather than confined to a customer’s own facilities, alongside the private and hybrid cloud services that it has emphasized in recent years. While cloud competitors Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.’s Azure pursue the providing of commodity computing infrastructure services, IBM is aiming for a higher-margin business that ties together its strategic imperatives for industries such as cybersecurity, finance, and health care.::::::::This approach has been slow to bear fruit, but it may prove to be a significant advantage, according to some analysts. Major cloud competitors “don’t have professional services businesses, so it’s difficult for them to deliver a specific solution to a business problem,” said analyst David Grossman of Stifel Financial Corp. “For IBM, that’s their legacy.”::::::::IBM recently expanded the reach of its cloud business into China, in March signing an agreement with Beijing-based service provider Wanda Internet Technology Group to form a new company, Wanda Cloud Company, based on IBM’s cloud platform.::::::::For the first quarter, IBM reported net income of $1.8 billion on $18.2 billion. It reported diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, of $2.38, up from $2.35 in the comparable 2016 period. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 on $18.4 billion in revenue, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.::::::::For the year, Big Blue reiterated its adjusted earnings-per-share forecast of at least $13.80 and called for earnings of $11.95 based on generally accepted accounting principles.

IBM 0.07% is piloting its Jeopardy-winning Watson technology as a tool for catching rogue traders at large financial institutions, executives said in an interview Monday.::::::::The company’s Watson Financial Services product looks for patterns in traders’ chats and emails while also analyzing numerical trading data. The surveillance tool is being piloted with a handful, or fewer than 10, financial-industry clients, said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of IBM Industry Platforms.::::::::The company is also developing other capabilities for the technology, Ms. van Kralingen said. One analyzes regulatory text to identify obligations that companies might face and to help assess whether the company’s compliance programs are sufficient to comply with the rules. Another would assist banks in detecting suspicious customers or transactions.::::::::The services are a new foray for IBM as it seeks to win a larger slice of the multibillion-dollar business of helping banks comply with regulations. The project is one of many efforts to make the Watson artificial intelligence computer program bear fruit six years after its debut besting human contestants on the Jeopardy game show.::::::::In September, IBM agreed to buy financial consultancy Promontory Financial Group, a move executives said was designed to help train Watson in the Byzantine business of bank rules.::::::::When it went on Jeopardy, Watson was a generalist, answering trivia questions about a range of topics. IBM has since been working to beef up its expertise in specific fields, such as treating cancer.::::::::The trader-surveillance capability is Watson’s most advanced in the financial-services realm, said Ms. Van Kralingen and Eugene Ludwig, who founded Promontory and continues to run it as part of IBM, in a joint interview Monday.::::::::They likened their effort to Watson’s application for medical diagnoses. In that context, Watson will read medical literature and consider patient histories and symptoms before offering a potential diagnosis. At a financial firm, Watson might analyze trader chats, emails, trading data, market data and other inputs to flag cases where a bank employee might be engaging in insider trading or market manipulation.::::::::The pitch is that banks need Watson because compliance officers alone can’t analyze all that information, and because other technology relies on more rudimentary tools such as searching emails for words that might raise red flags. Watson, IBM says, analyzes more data and is more sophisticated in identifying patterns.::::::::“I think about it like a detective that can do problem solving, rather than just a search. And that is the difference that many risk and compliance officers are desperate for,” said Ms. Van Kralingen.::::::::She said Watson is learning how to move beyond its ability to process language, which was the basis for its competition on Jeopardy, to work with numerical financial data.::::::::The capability for Watson to analyze regulatory text and banks’ own compliance systems is still under construction, she said. That project is relying both on Promontory’s stable of expert former regulators and on data that Promontory has created identifying individual obligations for banks among thousands of pages of federal rules, the executives said.::::::::In the anti-money-laundering arena, IBM is trying to create a tool that would be better than existing technology at identifying suspicious transactions, they said. The goal is for the technology to generate fewer “false positives”—transaction alerts that banks spend time investigating, only to find out later that they are innocuous.::::::::Mr. Ludwig said that “the enthusiasm is unbelievable” among potential clients for the anti-money-laundering tool.::::::::To be sure, the learning process for Watson can be a long road. Previous projects have run into hurdles. One attempt to use it in cancer treatment at a Texas hospital stalled due in part to challenges of integrating the technology with the hospital’s data systems, even though IBM said Watson itself was working effectively in that context.

In addition to helping assistants order office supplies and track shipments for supplies like pens and sticky notes by voice commands, it can also find and deliver other products that Staples itself might not carry.::::::::“Our goal would be to make their lives more efficient and be able to serve them beyond just office supplies,” said Mr. Masud, who became the company’s CTO in December 2016 in a promotion that combined e-commerce with his previous chief information officer responsibilities. “We want to be able to solve any request that our customers have.”::::::::Those requests could include orders for airplane tires or elevator parts and golf carts, the company said. In that case, the AI system would hand the customer off to a Staples procurement agent where the customer could speak with the agent directly through the easy button, which would act as an intercom.::::::::By early next year, the company could offer the Easy System as a product for business customers or as a part of the Staples Business Advantage program for businesses with annual Staples contracts. The Easy System pilot program is currently only available for companies within Staples Business Advantage. The Easy System could also be integrated into third-party chat platforms such as Facebook Inc.’s Messenger and Slack by next year, a company spokesman said.::::::::Staples uses application programming interfaces to connect its inventory and ordering systems to Watson, via IBM cloud technology.::::::::The system checks contracts and business processes set up for each customer, to ensure an order meets appropriate approvals, Mr. Masud said in a previous interview. If an order exceeds a spending threshold, for example, it could be routed by email, website or mobile app to a supervisor for an override.::::::::When an easy button is activated in an office by saying “Hey Easy,” the platform is securely connected to a Staples Business Advantage account where company administrators can manage activity and orders.::::::::The physical and digital Easy Systems securely connect to corporate wi-fi and require a password, as well as 4G connectivity. One of the versions of the easy button will also offer 4G connectivity so that a customer could use it without connecting to Wi-Fi.::::::::The company says the button does not actively listen to customers without permission.::::::::Staples on Monday announced the appointment of its first chief information security officer, Brett Wahlin, who will be responsible for information, product and data security. Mr. Wahlin was formerly vice president and chief information security officer at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Co. He will report to Mr. Masud.::::::::In late 2014, Staples said criminals stole personal information from as many as 1.16 million payment cards during the back-to-school shopping season at 113 stores.
