"30327"	"2015-03-03"	"Hillary Clinton's use of private email address while Secretary of State draws scrutiny"	"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a personal e-mail account to exclusively conduct official business during her time at the State Department, a move that raises questions about access to the full archive of her correspondence, as well as the possibility that she violated federal law requiring official messages to be retained for the record.::::::::The existence of the account was discovered by the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and was first reported by The New York Times.::::::::Clinton did not even have a government e-mail address during her tenure as America's top diplomat, which lasted from 2009 to 2013, and The Times reports that her aides took no action to preserve her emails on department servers, as required by the Federal Records Act.::::::::Instead, the paper reports, Clinton's advisers selected which of her emails to turn over to the State Department for archival purposes after going through tens of thousands of pages of correspondence. The department said late Monday that it had received 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails as part of a request made to previous secretaries of state to turn over any official documents they may have had in their possession.::::::::It is not clear how many total emails from that period were in Clinton's personal account, nor is it clear how Clinton's advisers decided which emails to hand over to the State Department.::::::::Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, told The Times that the former Secretary of State expected that emails to State Department officials would be preserved. The fate of emails to foreign leaders, private citizens, and non-State Department officials is unclear.::::::::""The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton’s records -- including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told Fox News late Monday. Harf added that the department turned over about 300 emails to the Benghazi select committee, and noted that Clinton's successor as Secretary of State, John Kerry, ""is the first ... to rely primarily on a state.gov e-mail account.""::::::::Records officials interviewed by The Times expressed grave concern over Clinton's practice, saying it represents a severe ethical breach and noting that personal e-mail accounts are far less secure than official ones.::::::::Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, told the paper he found it ""very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private e-mail communications channel for the conduct of government business."" Baron added that the use of private e-mail accounts is meant to be reserved only for emergencies, such as when a department's server is not working or compromised.::::::::However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms.::::::::The report has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans, including at least one potential challenger in the 2016 presidential race. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who released 250,000 emails from his gubernatorial tenure this past December, tweeted about the contrast between his disclosures and Clinton's secrecy.::::::::Clinton is widely believed to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016.

"30343"	"2015-03-03"	"Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules"	"WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials’ correspondence be retained as part of the agency’s record.::::::::Mrs. Clinton did not have a government email address during her four-year tenure at the State Department. Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act.::::::::It was only two months ago, in response to a new State Department effort to comply with federal record-keeping practices, that Mrs. Clinton’s advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department. All told, 55,000 pages of emails were given to the department. Mrs. Clinton stepped down from the secretary’s post in early 2013.::::::::Her expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach.::::::::“It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,” said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.::::::::A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, defended her use of the personal email account and said she has been complying with the “letter and spirit of the rules.”::::::::Under federal law, however, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them. There are exceptions to the law for certain classified and sensitive materials.::::::::Mrs. Clinton is not the first government official — or first secretary of state — to use a personal email account on which to conduct official business. But her exclusive use of her private email, for all of her work, appears unusual, Mr. Baron said. The use of private email accounts is supposed to be limited to emergencies, experts said, such as when an agency’s computer server is not working.::::::::“I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business,” said Mr. Baron, who worked at the agency from 2000 to 2013.::::::::Regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration at the time required that any emails sent or received from personal accounts be preserved as part of the agency’s records.::::::::But Mrs. Clinton and her aides failed to do so.::::::::How many emails were in Mrs. Clinton’s account is not clear, and neither is the process her advisers used to determine which ones related to her work at the State Department before turning them over.::::::::“It’s a shame it didn’t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have,” said Thomas S. Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, a group based at George Washington University that advocates government transparency. “Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back. Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment.”::::::::Mr. Blanton said high-level officials should operate as President Obama does, emailing from a secure government account, with every record preserved for historical purposes.::::::::“Personal emails are not secure,” he said. “Senior officials should not be using them.”::::::::Penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare, because the National Archives has few enforcement abilities.::::::::Mr. Merrill, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, declined to detail why she had chosen to conduct State Department business from her personal account. He said that because Mrs. Clinton had been sending emails to other State Department officials at their government accounts, she had “every expectation they would be retained.” He did not address emails that Mrs. Clinton may have sent to foreign leaders, people in the private sector or government officials outside the State Department.::::::::The revelation about the private email account echoes longstanding criticisms directed at both the former secretary and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for a lack of transparency and inclination toward secrecy.::::::::And others who, like Mrs. Clinton, are eyeing a candidacy for the White House are stressing a very different approach. Jeb Bush, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, released a trove of emails in December from his eight years as governor of Florida.::::::::It is not clear whether Mrs. Clinton’s private email account included encryption or other security measures, given the sensitivity of her diplomatic activity.::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, has used a government email account since taking over the role, and his correspondence is being preserved contemporaneously as part of State Department records, according to his aides.::::::::Before the current regulations went into effect, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who served from 2001 to 2005, used personal email to communicate with American officials and ambassadors and foreign leaders.::::::::Last October, the State Department, as part of the effort to improve its record keeping, asked all previous secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine K. Albright to provide it with any records, like emails, from their time in office for preservation.::::::::“These steps include regularly archiving all of Secretary Kerry’s emails to ensure that we are capturing all federal records,” said a department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki.::::::::The existence of Mrs. Clinton’s personal email account was discovered by a House committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi as it sought correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and her aides about the attack.::::::::Two weeks ago, the State Department, after reviewing Mrs. Clinton’s emails, provided the committee with about 300 emails — amounting to roughly 900 pages — about the Benghazi attacks.::::::::Mrs. Clinton and the committee declined to comment on the contents of the emails or whether they will be made public.::::::::The State Department, Ms. Psaki said, “has been proactively and consistently engaged in responding to the committee’s many requests in a timely manner, providing more than 40,000 pages of documents, scheduling more than 20 transcribed interviews and participating in several briefings and each of the committee’s hearings.”"

For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained.”::::::::Clinton “immediately said yes” when the State Department asked former secretaries last year for help preserving e-mail records, he said.::::::::“Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved,” Merrill said.::::::::It was not clear why Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, created the private account. But the practice appears to bolster long-standing criticism that Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have not been transparent.::::::::“Hillary Clinton should release her e-mails,” said Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is also weighing a presidential bid. “Hopefully she hasn’t already destroyed them.”::::::::Campbell noted that Bush ­created a Web site, at ­www.jebemails.com, providing public access to his electronic communications while in office. “Governor Bush believes transparency is a critical part of public service and of governing,” she said in a statement.::::::::Clinton’s aides reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal e-mails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department, the Times reported. In total, 55,000 pages of e-mails were turned over, the newspaper reported.::::::::Clinton was not the first secretary of state to use a private account. The State Department said Clinton’s successor as top diplomat, John F. Kerry, is the first secretary to use a standard government e-mail address ending in “state.gov.”::::::::Psaki played down the effect of Clinton’s use of a private account.::::::::“The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton’s records — including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts, as well as cables,” Psaki said in the statement.::::::::Clinton never had such an address and relied exclusively on the private account, the Times reported. The Times said Clinton’s aides took no action during her four years as secretary to ensure that the records would be preserved on department servers, as required by the Federal Records Act.::::::::It is not clear whether Clinton retained copies of all the e-mails from her four years at the department.::::::::“The department is in the process of updating our records preservation policies to bring them in line with recent 2013 National Archives and Records Administration guidance,” Psaki said. “These steps include regularly archiving all of Secretary Kerry’s emails to ensure that we are capturing all federal records.”"

"30460"	"2015-03-03"	"Clinton's Private E-Mail Use Ran Counter to Obama's Records Push"	"(Bloomberg) -- Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail account while U.S. Secretary of State may not have broken the law though it exposed her to hacking and ran counter to the Obama administration’s policy of preserving electronic records.::::::::Security specialists say she also failed to take adequate precautions to safeguard the account -- which she used for all her official business.::::::::“It’s not clear to me whether any laws were broken,” said John Wonderlich, policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that advocates for government transparency. “What clearly was violated was our public expectations for how public records work.”::::::::The revelations come as Clinton is preparing to announce a campaign for the Democratic nomination for president as soon as April. Her activities at the State Department and her work with the foundation already are providing fodder for Republican critics who say Clinton hasn’t been fully transparent about her activities at the State Department.::::::::The use of a private e-mail by Clinton, who served as Secretary of State from 2009 until February 2013, was discovered after a congressional committee sought Clinton’s e-mails during its investigation into the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. The attack killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.::::::::Deputy Press Secretary Marie Harf said Secretary of State John Kerry is the first in his position to rely primarily on a state.gov e-mail account.::::::::Harf said that the State Department has “no indication that Secretary Clinton used her personal e-mail account for anything but unclassified purposes.”::::::::Harf said that while Clinton didn’t have a classified e-mail system, she had multiple ways of communicating in a classified manner, including assistants printing documents for her, secure phone calls and secure video conferences.::::::::“The use of a personal e-mail address to skirt public records laws, aside from failing to meet the security standards one would expect of the nation’s top diplomat, enabled Clinton to shield her official communications from scrutiny by the media and the American public,” Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.::::::::However, prior to Kerry, secretaries of state didn’t regularly use an official State Department account, according to an agency official who wasn’t authorized to speak on the record. Colin Powell installed a personal laptop in his State Department office and used personal e-mail to communicate with ambassadors and foreign ministers as well as his assistants. On trips, he would often access the e-mail account from various embassies around the world.::::::::“The Clinton case is just the most recent example of a cavalier attitude toward the public record,” said Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, a private, nonprofit group based at George Washington University that was founded to counter government secrecy. “There’s a difference of opinion” about whether Clinton broke the law, he said.::::::::In 2011, President Barack Obama ordered Clinton and other department heads to improve management of electronic records, including e-mails and social media. In response to criticism of Gary Gensler, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and officials at the Department of Energy for using private e-mail addresses, the National Archivist issued guidance in 2013 saying government “employees should not generally use personal e-mail accounts to conduct official agency business.”::::::::While that guidance came after Clinton left office, its message should have been self-evident before hand to public officials, advocates for government openness say.::::::::“Secretary Clinton chose to create a private walled garden” where she’s blocked access from the public into her e-mail records, said Wonderlich, of the Sunlight Foundation.::::::::A regulation issued in 2009 established that electronic records of government business must be saved. So, even before the 2013 guidance, “the use of a private account was to be rare and occasional, and not to be the norm,” said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at DrinkerBiddle and former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. “To solely use a personal e-mail for four years is something that is highly unusual,” Baron said. Using a private account “without using an official account is inconsistent with the Federal Records Act.”::::::::Clinton showed a surprising lack of security awareness by using private e-mails and put communications at risk of being intercepted by hackers and foreign spies, said Ken Westin, a security analyst with Tripwire Inc. based in Portland, Oregon.::::::::Westin examined the registration of Clinton’s domain, clintonemail.com, which she established to support her e-mail account. She established the domain in January 2009, the month she became secretary, through Network Solutions LLC based in Jacksonville, Florida. It’s a paid service, unlike free Gmail or other e-mail services, and the person who registered the domain is private.::::::::However, a simple step to secure the domain wasn’t turned on, Westin said. “It’s a minor thing that someone who was concerned about security would implement on that domain,” he said.::::::::“She’s not a trained IT professional so I don’t think there would be anyway for her to know if she’s been compromised,” he said. “If I were a foreign nation and I gained access to this e-mail account, I would want to be very quiet about it.”::::::::To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Drajem in Washington at mdrajem@bloomberg.net; Nicole Gaouette in Washington at ngaouette@bloomberg.net; Chris Strohm in Washington at cstrohm1@bloomberg.net::::::::To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net Michael Shepard"

Bush said neither official routinely sent e-mails to staffers while they held those posts. Rice ""did not use her personal e-mail for official communication as Secretary"" and instead exclusively used her State Department account, according to a top aide who did not want to be quoted publicly.::::::::Attorney General Eric Holder regularly uses his government account, according to spokesman Brian Fallon, as does Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also used a government e-mail account while serving in that post.::::::::As Clinton aides have noted, Colin Powell did regularly use a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.::::::::A Powell aide confirmed that information, saying ""General Powell used a personal email account during his tenure as Secretary of State. He was not aware of any restrictions nor does he recall being made aware of any over the four years he served at State.""::::::::Other former office holders rarely used email accounts - personal or official - at all during their tenure.::::::::""President Bush never used email in the White House. We only ever spoke on the phone or in person, or through memos, of course. I think it was the same at the Treasury Department, too. I never emailed with any of the three secretaries I worked with,"" said Tony Fratto, a former Deputy White House Press Secretary in the George W. Bush administration. Fratto is supporting Jeb Bush's 2016 presidential run.::::::::""Everyone in government is wary of email,"" he added. ""I'm surprised that Secretary Clinton used a personal account. I'm surprised she used email at all, to be honest. It's so hard to keep it secure.""::::::::Steve Clemons, a foreign policy expert at The Atlantic, said he has ""never dealt with anyone at the highest levels of government who didn't have an official email address.""::::::::""The issue of disclosure here is that private email addresses are easily penetrated. The issue here is not so much that she had a private email address, but rather how much the Chinese and Russians got from her private email address conversations, as they no doubt were tracking her,"" Clemons added.::::::::Clinton aides have not indicated why exactly the former Secretary of State did not use a State Department e-mail address. It's not clear what e-mail server she used , or if it was more or less secure than those run by the government.::::::::A story in the New York Times, published Monday, described how Clinton had ""exclusively"" used a personal e-mail account during her four years as Secretary of State.::::::::Generally, letters and e-mails written by federal officials in their official positions are conducted on government accounts. They are archived and can sometimes be accessed by congressional committees or the public.::::::::The disclosure about Clinton's emails, in fact, comes as the House of Representatives is investigating the attack on the U.S diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, while Clinton was still Secretary of State. Clinton has released thousands of pages of her emails.::::::::""Like Secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials,"" said Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, in a statement. ""For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes.""::::::::He added, ""Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved. As a result of State's request for our help to make sure they in fact were, that is what happened here.""::::::::For Clinton, who is expected to officially start her presidential campaign in the next few months, the email disclosure could be a political blow, although she remains the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans, including GOP contender Jeb Bush, have sharply attacked Clinton about the controversy, arguing that her use of a personal email account was an intentional move to obscure her communications.::::::::And a prominent Democrat, former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, said Tuesday that Clinton's use of the account is ""highly unusual.""::::::::""I think it's something they're going to have to explain in good measure today and probably figure out how to get a lot of those emails, or as many as they can back into the archive,"" he said on NBC's TODAY Show."

Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and head of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said the private account has helped Mrs. Clinton avoid answering questions about the terrorist attack that claimed four American lives, as well as the administration’s actions in the aftermath of that attack.::::::::SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton email shenanigans help skirt Benghazi probe: Gowdy::::::::“We’ve been asking [the State Department] for months and months and months for certain emails, and we just now find out that those emails were never going to be produced because they don’t have custody of them,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Right now we are in a position of having to go to her or her attorneys to ask for work that was done on behalf of the American people. The records custodian should be at the State Department. The records custodian should not be in her private law firm.”::::::::Experts say the case of Mrs. Clinton is perhaps the most egregious example to date of the administration failing to live up to its own lofty promises about transparency.::::::::“It’s pretty stunning,” said John Wonderlich, policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for open government."

(John Woods/AP)::::::::Hillary Rodham Clinton is not the first senior government leader to conduct official business on personal e-mail, a practice that — while discouraged — apparently became widespread enough that Congress tightened rules on its use late last year.::::::::The Federal Records Act prohibits official business on private e-mail accounts unless the communications are copied and turned over to the National Archives within 20 days.::::::::The new oversight is part of the government’s evolving policy on how to archive the massive electronic communications created in a digital age of e-mail, tweets and Instagram. It follows a flurry of disclosures that several Cabinet secretaries — including former Environmental Protection agency chief Lisa Jackson and former heath and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius — used private or secondary government e-mail accounts.::::::::The continuing use of non-::::::::official accounts for official business has attracted congressional inquiries amid questions about transparency. On Wednesday, the head of the small EPA office that investigates chemical accidents is scheduled to testify at a House Oversight hearing on an inspector general’s report that he and two deputies discussed internal disputes about agency operations on private e-mail accounts and did not preserve them.::::::::Several large agencies, including the Defense, State, Treasury, Interior and Homeland Security departments and the EPA, said their senior leaders restrict all government business to government e-mail accounts. John F. Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely on a government e-mail account, officials said.::::::::The EPA “discourages the use of private e-mails,” an agency spokesman said. “Our policy is to forward e-mails initiated from and received by private e-mail accounts to government e-mail accounts to create a record in the EPA e-mail system . . . within 20 days.”::::::::A Treasury Department spokesman said Secretary Jack Lew conducts official department business on government e-mail. “Treasury policy is that employees should conduct official business through their official treasury e-mail accounts. The policy recognizes that there are situations in which an employee must use a personal e-mail account for work purposes. In those circumstances, the employee must ensure that all federal records are preserved,” the spokesman said.::::::::At the Department of Veterans Affairs, benefits chief Allison Hickey is known to hand out her “work e-mail” and said she answers veterans’ inquiries in the middle of the night. But while she encourages veterans to e-mail her directly, she does not use a personal e-mail for anything work-::::::::related.::::::::Under federal law, communications of Cabinet secretaries and their deputies are government records that must be preserved so that Congress, historians, the news media and the public can see them, with exceptions for classified and sensitive materials.::::::::But policies on managing these records in an electronic age are evolving slowly. The Archives has been debating new policies and building new computer systems to preserve the documents.::::::::Agencies in the past sent official documents to the Archives in paper boxes. Now, the task of saving ephemeral communications and complying with transparency requirements at the same time is the subject of heated debate.::::::::“It is perfectly understandable why someone who is secretary of state is using a private e-mail system,” said Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the Archives, referring to Clinton. “It’s easier than logging in from an airplane to a Citrix connection. But for four years, it was used as the sole system, and no one seemed to notice.”::::::::At the time, Clinton’s aides did not take actions to have her personal e-mails preserved on agency computer servers, as the records act requires. But in seeking to comply with new record-keeping requirements from the Archives, she turned over thousands of pages of her personal e-mails to the State Department, officials said.::::::::“The department is in the process of updating our records preservation policies to bring them in line with recent 2013 [Archives] guidance,” spokeswoman Marie Harf said. “These steps include regularly archiving all of Secretary Kerry’s e-mails to ensure that we are capturing all federal records.”::::::::E-mails have been considered official government records since the late 1980s. The White House set up an archiving system for presidential electronic records in the mid-1990s, when Bill Clinton was president.::::::::It wasn’t until 2011, amid pressure from advocates, that President Obama required a “modernized records management” system for federal agencies. All e-mail records must be archived by 2016. Agencies can decide which to save for the public and for how many years.::::::::Until then, the Archives offered only vague guidance on the use of official e-mail. The agency issued regulations in 2009 requiring e-mails sent on non-government accounts to be preserved “in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.”::::::::Jackson, the former EPA chief, drew criticism for using a secondary e-mail account to communicate with staff and other government officials. The EPA inspector general found no evidence that e-mail was used in a way that circumvented federal requirements. Sebelius also used a separate e-mail account for agency business.::::::::If the use of personal e-mail is not a violation, as long as communications are forwarded and stored, they are officially subject to the Freedom of Information Act. But this raises red flags for open government advocates, who say there is no way to monitor whether a government official picks and chooses which communications to save.::::::::Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, said, “The policy really should say no private e-mail accounts. Leaving to the government official who wrote the e-mail to decide what’s public is not adequate.”::::::::Alice Crites, Joby Warrick, Missy Ryan, Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, Jerry Markon and Steven Mufson in Washington and Carol Morello in Montreux, Switzerland, contributed to this report."
"30546"	"2015-03-03"	"Clinton's e-mail practices contrary to official guidance"	"Aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton have declined to explain why she did not set up a State Department e-mail account. (Kevin Lamarque/AP)::::::::Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton appears to have operated in violation of what the White House said Tuesday was “very specific guidance” that members of the Obama administration use government e-mail accounts to carry out official business.::::::::Clinton did not have a government account at the State Department but instead used her personal e-mail account. That was permissible only if all e-mails relating to government business were turned over and archived by the State Department, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at his daily briefing.::::::::“Very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees in the Obama administration should use their official e-mail accounts when they’re conducting official government business,” Earnest said. “However, when there are situations where personal e-mail accounts are used, it is important for those records to be preserved, consistent with the Federal Records Act.”::::::::[Clinton not the first senior leader to use personal e-mail for official business ]::::::::Earnest said the administration would have to rely on Clinton’s assurances that she met the fallback requirement of sending along the pertinent e-mails to be archived.::::::::In Clinton’s case, that happened only after the State Department requested records from her and other former secretaries last fall, around the time the records law was updated.::::::::About 300 of Clinton’s recovered e-mails were turned over to a congressional committee investigating the 2012 deaths of four Americans at U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. The chairman of that panel, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), said Tuesday that the former secretary of state used multiple personal accounts.::::::::“You do not need a law degree to have an understanding of how troubling this is,” Gowdy told reporters at a news conference. “One should also be concerned about the national security implications of former secretary Clinton using exclusively personal e-mail accounts for the conducting of official U.S. foreign policy.”::::::::But Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said that “both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use nongovernment e-mail, as long as appropriate records were preserved.” He noted that the current secretary of state, John F. Kerry, is the first one to have an official e-mail account.::::::::Aides to Clinton declined to explain why she did not set up a State Department e-mail account.::::::::By the time she came to the department, in 2009, the practice of high government officials conducting government business using personal e-mail accounts had become controversial. Democrats were intensely critical of George W. Bush administration officials, including top political strategist Karl Rove, who used an account registered by the Republican National Committee for e-mails sent from the White House.::::::::There was also a question of timing: Registry information indicates that the domain clintonemail.com, which was used for some of her personal e-mails, was created on Jan. 13, 2009 — one week before Obama was sworn into office and the same day Clinton’s confirmation hearings began before the Senate.::::::::At the State Department, spokeswoman Marie Harf said, “there was no prohibition on using a non-state.gov account for official business, as long as it’s preserved.”::::::::“In the process of updating our records management — this is something that’s sort of ongoing given technology and the changes — we reached out to all of the former secretaries of state to ask them to provide any records they have,” she said.::::::::Clinton was the only former secretary to send back e-mail records in response to the department’s request, Harf said.::::::::She also said that the department has “no indications” that Clinton used personal e-mail for classified information.::::::::“She had multiple other ways of communicating in a classified manner, including assistants or staff members printing classified documents for her, secure phone calls, or secure videoconferences,” Harf said.::::::::Because she used personal e-mail, it was left to Clinton and her aides to determine which communications would end up in government archives, officials and experts said.::::::::Both allies and critics say Clinton’s tendency to hold information close has often caused her political problems, going back to her years as first lady.::::::::Early in husband Bill Clinton’s first term as president, Hillary Clinton was put in charge of his signature effort — an overhaul of the nation’s health-care system. She chose to operate largely behind the scenes, initially refusing even to release the names of the 500 people who worked on the task force that helped put together her proposal.::::::::Clinton White House officials also faulted the first lady for stonewalling when reporters began probing a failed Arkansas land deal known as Whitewater. After she refused to make documents related to the deal public, an independent prosecutor was appointed — leading to the investigation that ultimately spiraled into a sex scandal and Bill Clinton’s impeachment.::::::::ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, then one of the president’s top advisers, wrote in his memoir that the decision to withhold the documents from public scrutiny was the White House’s biggest mistake and the thing he would pick “if a genie offered me the chance to turn back time and undo a single decision from my White House tenure.”::::::::“On this issue, Clinton wasn’t commander in chief, just a husband beholden to his wife,” Stephanopoulos wrote. “. . . Hillary didn’t want it out — and she had a veto.”::::::::Republicans, including some of her potential 2016 rivals, quickly pounced on the revelations about Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail account.::::::::“Transparency matters,” former Florida governor Jeb Bush wrote on Twitter just hours after the news broke. His message said that Clinton’s “emails should be released,” as his were, and he included a link to his Web site, JebBushEmails.com.::::::::However, all the e-mails Bush has released were required to be made public under Florida law, and he has no plans to release any beyond those.::::::::Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said his panel will coordinate with the Benghazi committee to determine whether Clinton’s use of personal e-mail violated the law.::::::::When Earnest was asked whether that was a possibility, he said: “I come down wherever the State Department attorney comes down.”::::::::He added that “based on what we know,” Clinton and her aides acted legally.::::::::Ed O’Keefe and Philip Bump contributed to this report."

This was not bucking the system; this was in keeping with exactly what former Secretaries had done.""::::::::Clinton, according to her spokesman, Nick Merrill, ""used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained.""::::::::One of her predecessors, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, appears to have used his personal email in much the same way. He wrote in his book, ""It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership:""::::::::""To complement the official State Department computer in my office, I installed a laptop computer on a private line. My personal email account on the laptop allowed me direct access to anyone online. I started shooting emails to my principal assistants, to individual ambassadors, and increasingly to my foreign-minister colleagues who like me were trying to bring their ministries into the 186,000-miles-per-second world.""::::::::Indeed, John Kerry is, according to the State Department, the first secretary of state whose primary account is a state.gov email address.::::::::Last year, the State Department asked former Secretaries for help in retaining their email records. Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails, ""anything pertaining to her work there,"" a Clinton aide told Brennan. ""So if she emailed with her daughter about flower arrangements for her wedding, that didn't go in, but if she emailed one of the 100 State Department officials she regularly corresponded with, State had it in their servers already, and HRC's office replicated that to ensure it was all there. 9 out of 10 emails that she sent over the course of her tenure went to the State Department.""::::::::Clinton's immediate predecessor, former Secretary Condoleezza Rice, rarely sent emails, and on the few occasions when she did, she used a State Department account.::::::::Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, ""Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved.""::::::::But National Archives Record Administration (NARA) regulations demand that if agency employees are using an outside mail system instead of that provided by their workplace, they ""must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record keeping system.""::::::::And one attorney who used to work for the Archives suggested that even though Clinton's email habits are attracting second looks, legally, she's in the clear. There is little doubt that the record keeping is now more difficult, though. Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said that there should have been an early conversation with Clinton about the expectations of the record keeping act, and ""the expectation is built into the regulations that there would be a timely transfer of emails to an appropriate record keeping system."" ""Timely"" in this case is a little vague, but Baron said, ""The transfer doesn't have to be in real time but it doesn't mean years later either.""::::::::The select committee on Benghazi, which has obtained 300 of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails as part of its investigation, said Tuesday that Clinton's use of a personal email address means the Committee isn't finished collecting documents from her.::::::::Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, told reporters, ""The State Department does not have all of Secretary Clinton's emails on its servers. Only she has a complete record, and the committee is going to have to go to her, her attorneys and her email providers to ensure we have access to everything we are entitled to know.""::::::::Ranking Member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, issued a statement saying that Clinton's use of a personal account ""has been public for several years,"" and said that the committee received Clinton's emails relating to Benghazi last month, and he called on Gowdy to ""join with me to make them available to the American public so they can read their contents for themselves."""

Bush was president, senior adviser Karl Rove had used an address through the Republican National Committee to conduct some business.::::::::A National Public Radio report said Chuck Hagel had not used an official account when he was defense secretary.::::::::It is unclear what the damage from the report will be. The rules governing high-level officials' emails have been in flux in recent years, so it is far from certain that any formal action will be taken against Clinton.::::::::But it does provide ammunition for critics, especially for a congressional committee investigating the events surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012, attack against a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, in which the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed.::::::::Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican congressman who chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said the committee learned recently that Clinton had used more than one personal email address.::::::::""The fact is the State Department cannot certify they have produced all of former Secretary Clinton’s emails because they do not have all of former Secretary Clinton’s emails, nor do they control access to them,"" he said.::::::::Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah said the House Oversight Committee, which he chairs, will work with the Benghazi committee ""to further explore Hillary Clinton’s use of personal emails while at the State Department.""::::::::Jeb Bush, a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination who recently released a trove of emails from his time as Florida governor, many sent on his personal account, demanded Clinton's emails be made public.::::::::Officials acknowledge that Clinton used a personal email account throughout her State Department tenure.::::::::The State Department said Clinton last year turned over emails from the period after a records request and that 300 of these were sent to a committee investigating Benghazi.::::::::A total of 55,000 pages of material covering the time she was in office were turned over, the agency said.::::::::The Obama administration has acknowledged that the federal government is still in the process of modernizing its policy on archiving emails and other digital information.::::::::Federal agency heads were told in August 2012 they would have to start keeping electronic records of all emails. A subsequent memo said explicitly that work performed through a personal email address may also need to be archived.::::::::Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said he believed that ""the sole use of a private email account by a high-level official to transact government business is plainly inconsistent with the Federal Records Act and longstanding policies of the National Archives.""::::::::However, James Lewis, a technical expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the reality is many senior officials use personal email.::::::::""The issue here was intent. Was she doing it deliberately to avoid having her emails tracked, and was there classified information?"" he said."
"30565"	"2015-03-03"	"Using Private Email, Hillary Clinton Thwarted Record Requests"	"WASHINGTON — In 2012, congressional investigators asked the State Department for a wide range of documents related to the attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The department eventually responded, furnishing House committees with thousands of documents.::::::::But it turns out that that was not everything.::::::::The State Department had not searched the email account of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton because she had maintained a private account, which shielded it from such searches, department officials acknowledged on Tuesday.::::::::It was only last month that the House committee appointed to investigate Benghazi was provided with about 300 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails related to the attacks. That was shortly after Mrs. Clinton turned over, at the State Department’s request, some 50,000 pages of government-related emails that she had kept on her private account.::::::::It was one of several instances in which records requests sent to the State Department, which had no access to Mrs. Clinton’s emails, came up empty.::::::::In 2013, Nitasha Tiku, then a reporter for Gawker, filed a Freedom of Information Act request, seeking all correspondence on Mrs. Clinton’s private email account between her and Sidney Blumenthal, a close adviser and onetime staff member in the Clinton White House. Some of those emails had already spilled into public view and been reported in the news media. But the State Department told Gawker that it could find no records responsive to the request, Gawker reported.::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s aides on Tuesday sought to play down the significance of her exclusive use of a personal email account for State Department business. But an examination of records requests sent to the department reveals how the practice protected a significant amount of her correspondence from the eyes of investigators and the public.::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of personal email for her government business is unusual for a high-level official, archive experts have said. Federal regulations, since 2009, have required that all emails be preserved as part of an agency’s record-keeping system. In Mrs. Clinton’s case, her emails were kept on her personal account and her staff took no steps to have them preserved as part of State Department record.::::::::In response to a State Department request, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, late last year, reviewed her account and decided which emails to turn over to the State Department.::::::::The State Department says it will now search the 50,000 emails Mrs. Clinton provided in response to Freedom of Information and congressional requests.::::::::The White House, in its first response to the news, said it frowned on the practice of officials using their personal email accounts.::::::::“What I can tell you is that very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees of the Obama administration should use their official email accounts when they’re conducting official government business,” the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said. “However, when there are situations where personal email accounts are used, it is important for those records to be preserved consistent with the Federal Records Act.”::::::::But political groups and news organizations said requests for records related to Mrs. Clinton had repeatedly gone unanswered.::::::::In December, The Associated Press said its FOIA requests for records related to Mrs. Clinton’s tenure at the State Department, the oldest of which was submitted in March 2010, were not answered. In addition to requesting Mrs. Clinton’s schedules, The A.P. asked for correspondence related to Huma Abedin’s special arrangement to serve as a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton and consult for private clients. “We have not received any documents yet, despite the promised deadlines, and we are evaluating the situation,” said Erin Madigan White, spokeswoman for The A.P.::::::::Conservative groups have filed numerous requests for information about Mrs. Clinton as she prepares for a possible presidential run. Citizens United is expecting a court ruling on Friday about a lawsuit the group filed last year after the State Department would not disclose flight records that would have shown who accompanied Mrs. Clinton on overseas trips. The group had intended to cross reference the agency’s flight manifests with the donors who contributed to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.::::::::The FOIA request was just one of 16 appeals the group has made to the State Department since May that have gone unfulfilled. Those requests also included specific correspondence from Mrs. Clinton and her closest aides, including Cheryl D. Mills and Ms. Abedin.::::::::America Rising, an anti-Clinton “super PAC,” has submitted a dozen FOIA requests for State Department records beginning last June.::::::::Requests included correspondence between Ms. Mills and Clinton Foundation leadership and Ms. Abedin’s communication with members of Teneo, a private consultancy partly run by Doug Band, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton. Ms. Abedin had a special arrangement that allowed her to work at the State Department and be paid by Teneo, which offers strategic advice to major global corporations. America Rising also requested Mrs. Clinton’s schedule during the annual Clinton Global Initiative gatherings in New York.::::::::In all cases, the State Department acknowledged receipt of the FOIA requests and assigned case numbers but did not produce any of the requested documents. “Unfortunately, Clinton’s own political calculation and desire for secrecy, as evidenced by her exclusive use of personal email accounts while at State, is preventing an open process and full, fair review of her time there,” said Jeff Bechdel, a spokesman for America Rising.::::::::State Department officials have previously said they handle thousands of records requests and try to respond as quickly as possible. On Tuesday, Alec Gerlach, a spokesman for the department, defended the agency, and stressed that it was working diligently to comply with the voluminous requests for information from the Republican-controlled House.::::::::Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton group, called the issue of Mrs. Clinton’s using personal email “manufactured controversy.”::::::::In a written statement, the National Archives said it had “reached out to the State Department to ensure that all federal records are properly identified and managed in accordance with the Federal Records Act and that controls and procedures are in place to manage records effectively in the future.”::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s aides have said her use of private email was not out of the ordinary, pointing to the fact that former Secretary of State Colin Powell also used a personal email account, before the current regulations went into effect. But since 2009, said Laura Diachenko, a National Archives and Records spokeswoman, federal regulations have stated that “agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.”::::::::The rules are designed to ensure a contemporaneous record of government activity is being kept so it will be available to members of Congress, the news media, historians and ordinary citizens.::::::::Secretary of State John Kerry uses a government email account, and his correspondence is preserved as part of the department’s record-keeping system."
"30571"	"2015-03-03"	"Clinton avoids e-mail flap during EMILY's List speech"	"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Democratic activists Tuesday to recommit to electing more women to public office, but avoided the e-mail controversy surrounding her own likely campaign to become the nation's first female president.::::::::In a speech to mark the 30th anniversary of EMILY's List, Clinton sounded economic themes familiar from her recent public appearances — denouncing the gaps in income between the wealthy and working poor and calling for paid sick days and family leave.::::::::""When any parent is shortchanged,"" she said, ""...our economy is shortchanged.""::::::::In a nearly 30-minute speech, however, she did not address the flap that erupted over news that she conducted government business on e-mail solely through a personal account during her tenure as secretary of State.::::::::The disclosures have raised questions about whether she may have violated federal rules on the retention of government records and drew rebukes from Republicans. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, a potential presidential candidate, tweeted ""Transparency matters"" on Monday night in response to the controversy, which was first reported by The New York Times.::::::::Clinton's appearance at the EMILY's List gala brought her to friendly turf on a tough day. The sold-out ballroom of activists and donors cheered wildly whenever her likely candidacy was mentioned in the warm-up speeches.::::::::""In 2008, Hillary Clinton put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling,"" EMILY's List founder Ellen Malcolm told the crowd, referring to the number of votes Clinton secured in her first bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.::::::::""In 2016, it's time to shatter that class ceiling and put a woman in the White House,"" she added to loud applause. ""Hillary, you heard us,"" Malcolm said. ""Just give us the word, and we'll be by your side.""::::::::Clinton herself made only passing references to a potential candidacy. ""Don't you want to see a woman president of the United States?"" she asked at one point, drawing the most sustained applause of her speech.::::::::She did not outline specific policy proposals but made broad criticisms of Republicans without singling out anyone by name.::::::::Watching Republicans talk about income inequality, she said, is ""like watching the end of Casablanca. 'My goodness. My goodness ... Round up the usual suspects.' ""::::::::Clinton said she doesn't want to discourage Republicans' ""new-found interest"" in the issue, but ""we're not buying that old, trickle-down economics that didn't work before and can never work again.""::::::::EMILY's List and its three million members, who pool together donations to back favored candidates, will be critical to Clinton's likely presidential bid. Malcolm served as national co-chair of Clinton's 2008 campaign.::::::::In the three decades since its founding, EMILY's List has raised $400 million to advance the political ambitions of Democratic women who support abortion rights. It collected more than $60 million in the 2014 cycle alone.::::::::EMILY's List president Stephanie Schriock recently resigned from a pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action — a move that will allow her to work more closely with a potential Clinton campaign. Federal rules bar coordination between super PACs and the politicians they support.::::::::The group, however, will remain deeply engaged in Priorities' activities. Denise Feriozzi, who oversees independent spending at EMILY's List, is taking over Schriock's seat on the super PAC's board.::::::::Clinton's appearance at the gala, where she received the ""We Are Emily"" award, became a focal point for her supporters and her critics alike. Ready for Hillary, a super PAC seeking to build grassroots momentum for her candidacy, scheduled parties around the country for supporters to view her address online. The gala's program was peppered with ads encouraging her to run and break what Clinton herself has called ""the highest, hardest glass ceiling.""::::::::In a statement, Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said Clinton ""will gladly attend fancy galas yet continues to hide from the American people.""::::::::Other speakers Tuesday night included California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for her state's open Senate seat; former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who has become one of the nation's biggest gun-control advocates after surviving a gun-shot wound to the head; and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who announced her retirement this week, ending her tenure as the longest-serving woman in congressional history.::::::::Mikulski promised to continue the fight to install more women in the halls of power, even after she leaves office in two years. ""Don't get mad,"" she urged aspiring female politicians. ""Get elected.""::::::::Clinton's appearance is the latest in a series of speeches the Democrat will make in the coming weeks focused on women – as she draws closer to a likely presidential bid.::::::::Next week, she is set to release a report marking the anniversary of the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, where she forcefully denounced abuses against women. On March 23, she will headline an awards ceremony for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, which honors the memory of Robin Toner, The New York Times' first female national political correspondent."
"30582"	"2015-03-04"	"Hillary Clinton's use of private email not unusual, but still raises questions"	"Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of personal email accounts as secretary of State mimicked her predecessors but drew attention to her penchant for secrecy as she begins what appears to be a second presidential run.::::::::Clinton turned her personal email over to the State Department last year so it could be saved for history, following “both the letter and the spirit of the rules,” Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the presumptive Democratic candidate, said in a statement Tuesday.::::::::Yet many of her emails became part of the record only when Clinton messaged State Department employees at their official addresses, he said, a practice that stops short of ensuring that every email Clinton wrote made its way into federal archives. The explanation left out what happened to her emails to foreign officials or others outside the government and what security concerns were raised by her use of a private email account.::::::::Clinton’s allies defended the practice, with one liberal group labeling questions about it a “right-wing attack.” Merrill cited former secretaries of State of both parties who did the same thing.::::::::“Like secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any department officials,” Merrill said. “For government business, she emailed them on their department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained.”::::::::The Clinton camp’s response recalled earlier instances of her political instinct for privacy and protection, honed over years in public life. As first lady in the early 1990s, for example, the secrecy surrounding the closed-door healthcare reform negotiations that she spearheaded for President Clinton helped contribute to their failure.::::::::Now, with Clinton widely considered the front-runner for her party’s presidential nomination even though she has yet to declare her candidacy, her team is facing questions about her high-profile role as the nation’s top diplomat during President Obama’s first term.::::::::“If the secretary was doing what she was supposed to do under the law, why would the State Department have to ask her for her emails back?” asked Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the chairman of a House select committee looking into the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that happened while Clinton ran the department. Four Americans were killed, including the ambassador.::::::::Word of Clinton’s private email account, first disclosed by the New York Times, put pressure on the White House to answer questions about an administration that Obama long has promised would be the most transparent in history. His team is supposed to conduct business on government email, yet some officials apparently exchanged messages with Clinton at one or more private email addresses when she was secretary of State.::::::::The top White House spokesman said he wasn’t sure whether anyone in the West Wing suspected Clinton wasn’t using an official email address like everyone else.::::::::“I’d be surprised if anybody did,” Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, while asserting that Clinton complied with the law.::::::::Federal law has long required agency directors to preserve documents generated in the course of business. The legal rules governing preservation of work emails from non-work accounts wasn’t explicit in the law until November, however, more than a year after Clinton left the administration.::::::::Clinton wouldn’t be the first digital-age official to steer carefully through the law to try to keep some control over correspondence. Republican former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, himself a likely presidential candidate, has controlled what messages might become public.::::::::Obama’s former Environmental Protection Agency director, Lisa P. Jackson, had an email account in the name of “Richard Windsor.” In the midst of an inquiry at the Internal Revenue Service, emails from the former agency administrator temporarily went missing.::::::::Clinton turned over some of her messages at the State Department’s request last year, which in turn released about 300 of them to Gowdy’s committee.::::::::Gowdy said the panel learned last summer that Clinton had used a personal account for official business. More recently, it learned she had exclusively used private email accounts — more than one — in lieu of an official one.::::::::Gowdy said State Department officials could not certify they had produced all of Clinton’s emails “because they do not have all of Secretary Clinton’s emails, nor do they control access to them.”::::::::“You do not need a law degree to have an understanding of how troubling this is,” he said.::::::::Democrats downplayed the significance of the private accounts, saying Clinton’s use of personal email has been public knowledge for years and follows a pattern of previous secretaries.::::::::Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the Benghazi committee, said the panel received Clinton’s emails relating to the 2012 attack last month. He called on Gowdy to “make them available to the American public so they can read their contents for themselves.”::::::::Gowdy is part of the “right-wing attack apparatus,” said Isaac Wright, executive director of Correct the Record, an arm of the liberal group American Bridge.::::::::“Like the secretaries of State before her, they were from a private email account,” Wright wrote in an email. “Will congressional Republicans show an equal interest in transparency in their own party?”::::::::The Federal Records Act requires that, day in and day out, Clinton or someone on her behalf assist in preserving emails, said Daniel J. Metcalfe, the founding director of the Department of Justice Office of Information and Privacy, who is now a teacher of secrecy law at American University's law school.::::::::“If there is official government activity, it ordinarily should be memorialized in a record. She can’t just be freewheeling all over the place with these communications and not worry about memorializing them or maintaining them,” he said.::::::::A decision not to set up a government account undermines a commitment to preservation, Metcalfe said. The most reliable way to generate a record would be with such an account.::::::::But there may be legitimate reasons to make some use of private email, he said.::::::::“If you’re the secretary of State and you’re responding to crises around the world 24 hours a day, sometimes you might not have your government phone handy,” he said. “Sometimes you’ll just have your personal phone. There should be some flexibility.”"
"30590"	"2015-03-04"	"Obama admin. fails to defend Hillary Clinton's email use"	"The Obama administration failed to rise to Hillary Clinton’s defense Tuesday over her use of personal email while secretary of state — saying employees were instructed to use their official government emails for business.::::::::During a briefing at which he was bombarded with questions about Clinton’s email practices while she served in the administration, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that “very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees in the Obama administration should use their official email accounts when they’re conducting official government business.”::::::::He admitted there were situations where personal accounts could be used. In those cases, “it is important for those records to be preserved, consistent with the Federal Records Act.”::::::::Earlier, Clinton aides, as well as outside groups backing her expected presidential run, pushed back hard on a report by The New York Times that Clinton may have violated federal regulations by using a personal email exclusively.::::::::“She had a BlackBerry. She used it prior to state, and like her predecessors she continued to use it when she got to state,” a Clinton aide said Tuesday. “This was not bucking the system; this was in keeping with exactly what former secretaries had done.”::::::::New regulations require officials to use email accounts that can be saved for archives.::::::::Clinton defenders pointed out that as secretary of state, Colin Powell also used a personal email account. Condoleezza Rice rarely used email as secretary of state, but when she did, she used a government account, a spokesman told Business Insider.::::::::Two months ago, complying with new federal record-keeping practices, “nine out of 10” emails Clinton sent were turned over to the State Department, her aide said.::::::::“If she emailed with her daughter about flower arrangements for her wedding, that didn’t go in, but if she emailed one of the 100 State Department officials she regularly corresponded with, state had it in their servers already, and (Clinton’s) office replicated that to ensure it was all there,” the aide said.::::::::Top Clinton aides like Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines had state.gov email domains and used them, a spokesman said. The liberal group Media Matters, which is backing a Clinton run, argued the law overseeing retention of private emails was not changed until after Clinton’s tenure at the State Department.::::::::But government watchdog groups said conducting public business through personal email was nonetheless deeply troubling.::::::::“A Wild West of weakly regulated email practice was actually a lot worse than we thought,” said John Wonderlich, policy director of the Sunlight Foundation. “I have a hard time seeing a justifiable incentive to building a private system.”::::::::Wonderlich also called it problematic that in deciding which emails to turn over to the State Department, it is “the people who report to Clinton that are making the call about what records to preserve.”::::::::Stories about the emails were a cloud hanging over Clinton’s highly anticipated speech Tuesday night at a 30th anniversary gala for the pro-women group Emily’s List in Washington. But she chose to ignore the matter and didn’t address it at all at the event.::::::::It was her second public speech in two weeks, a reemergence in the public sphere after a long period off the radar.::::::::Creating another headache for Clinton, the House select committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi — in which four Americans died — plans to review the issue as well, its chairman, Trey Gowdy, told CNN.::::::::Supporters said the story spelled trouble if she did break the rules.::::::::“This could look like the old Hillary: secretive, doesn’t trust anybody, doesn’t play by the rules,” said a longtime Clinton confidant. And even if she abided by State Department protocols, “the Republicans are still going to use this to say, what is she hiding, what did she have on there that was deleted?

Clinton ignored the issue during a speech Tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights.::::::::It was unclear whom Clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the AP traced to a mysterious identity, Eric Hoteham. That name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010.::::::::The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server. The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton.::::::::In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton's private email account was reconfigured to use Google's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google's accusations in June 2011 that China's government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking.::::::::Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton's private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company.::::::::The New York Times reported Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them.::::::::In theory but not in practice, Clinton's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed.::::::::The AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn't possess all her emails.::::::::Clinton's private email account surfaced publicly in March 2013 after a convicted Romanian hacker known as Guccifer published emails stolen from former White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination.::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the special House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, said the committee learned last summer -- when agency documents were turned over to the committee -- that Clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state. More recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one, Gowdy said.::::::::President Barack Obama signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days. The bill did not become law until more than one year after Clinton left the State Department."

Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010.::::::::The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server. The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton.::::::::In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton's private email account was reconfigured to use Google's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google's accusations in June 2011 that China's government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking.::::::::Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton's private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company.::::::::The New York Times reported Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them.::::::::In theory but not in practice, Clinton's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed.::::::::The AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn't possess all her emails.::::::::Clinton's private email account surfaced publicly in March 2013 after a convicted Romanian hacker known as Guccifer published emails stolen from former White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination.::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the special House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, said the committee learned last summer — when agency documents were turned over to the committee — that Clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state. More recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one, Gowdy said.::::::::President Barack Obama signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days. The bill did not become law until more than one year after Clinton left the State Department."

Other than perhaps hosting an event on electronic transparency for the exiled government of Libya, Clinton has found absolutely the worst place to be. She is going to attend a gala at a super-posh venue on Wall Street for her family foundation. Woof. Hitting what reportedly will be a glitzy event to raise more money from the global upper crust for a foundation at the center of a fundraising fiasco would be bad enough for the presumptive Democratic nominee even without the bizarre new and continually expanding scandal surrounding her private emails at the State Department. Prior to the new revelations, Clinton might have been able to blow off the press, schmooze with the .0001 percent and get back on the trail. But the revelations will turn tonight into a public embarrassment fitted like Versace gown for political attacks rather than a private indulgence.:::::::::::::::: [Power Play - How damaging will this latest scandal be and will Hillary need to come out and address it? Chris Stirewalt provides the lay of the land, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.]::::::::::::::::Enablers - One can’t blame Clinton for the bad timing. She certainly knew that dodging transparency and accountability measures would result in a scandal, but she couldn’t have known when. (When you are operating a “homebrew” server out of your house for official emails, you probably aren’t figuring it’s no big deal.) She must have imagined that she could ride out the bad press and that the disruption would be worth the advantages offered by secrecy and unaccountability. One cannot blame Clinton for the disastrous timing of this concatenation, but if she and her family can’t resist celebrating their Wall Street connections and big buckraking right now there is an evident lack of judgment at work. Through that lens, we get a better insight on why Clinton felt she could operate her own private email system when she worked for the government. Because she felt entitled to do so. As her campaign lumbers and lurches forward, we see entitlement at the core of many of Clinton’s problems. If there is not one of her many advisers who are able to convince Clinton that she must learn to live by the rules, this candidacy will be just as doomed as the last one.::::::::::::::::Sauce for the goose…  “At the end of the day, it looks like they were trying to avoid the records act ... by operating official business off the official systems,” –John Podesta, top adviser to Hillary Clinton, criticizing the Bush administration officials for using private emails in a 2007 WSJ interview.::::::::::::::::[À la Haig - Buzzfeed’sBen Smith got a telling response to a question he posed to John Podesta on Hillary Clinton’s emails. “…when I am in charge of the campaign I will return your calls.”]::::::::::::::::Look over here! - The Clinton campaign network sent a letter to Florida’s Department of State Tuesday “…requesting unreleased emails sent from Jeb Bush’s private email account during his time as governor. Recently, Bush was quick to brag about releasing 250,000 emails in his ostensible devotion to transparency -- but Bush said he received 550,000 emails on his private account and 2.5 million emails on his public account during his gubernatorial tenure.”:::::::::::::::: [The Atlantic dives into Clinton’s longstanding contempt for transparency and accountability measures, at least when applied to her.]::::::::::::::::(WHITE) HOUSE OF PAIN: NO PLAN TO AID THOSE WHO COULD BEAR BRUNT IN OBAMACARE CASE::::::::With Supreme Court arguments today on a case that could blow the bottom out of ObamaCare and put policies for millions at risk, the president and his team is reverting to the Clubber Lang doctrine for such standoffs. Their prediction: Pain. As the NYT reports, the administration is intentionally refusing to consider any backup plans at the risk of signaling “to the justices that reasonable solutions existed.”  And if past conduct is indicative, the president must also hope that by maximizing suffering in the short term, he can better block Republican alternatives and gain the upper hand on preserving his law in the eventual rescue operation. Meanwhile, no fewer than four Republican plans have emerged. The most recent is from by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and five co-sponsors, including Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. There are other, potentially complementary, plans already on offer including one includes financial assistance for individuals who would lose coverage, another that would offer tax credits and the one perhaps best suited for an emergency measure sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb.::::::::::::::::Government case rests in part on Jonathan Gruber’s honesty - WaPo: “MIT economist Jonathan Gruber first earned notoriety because of this challenge. Opponents of the law last summer circulated a 2012 video of him saying — contrary to the administration's argument — that states would deprive their residents of subsidies if they didn't set up their own exchanges. Gruber, who had widely been described as an architect of the ACA, later said the comments were a mistake.”::::::::::::::::Carpe diem - New in Fox News Opinion, former Romney policy adviser Lanhee Chen writes that Republicans should seize the opportunity to tackle the future of health care: “Liberal commentators are doing their best to portray a doomsday scenario for the American health care system if the plaintiffs in the case are victorious. And most importantly, President Obama is sure to blame Republicans if the impact of the case is lost coverage or higher premiums. There is a talented field of potential Republican candidates for the presidency in 2016, however, who should see the King case as an opportunity to make important arguments about the future of the American health care system.”:::::::::::::::: [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream has the latest on ObamaCare arguments live from the Supreme Court.]::::::::::::::::FEDS APPROVED AMNESTY FOR 100,000 BEFORE JUDGE HALTED:::::::: Stephen Dinan reports: “The administration processed about 100,000 applications for amnesty for so-called Dreamers under some of the expanded rules President Obama announced last year, lawyers told a Texas judge late Tuesday, in a move that could complicate their claim that they have halted all action under the amnesty. Mr. Obama’s Nov. 20 announcement offered a number of different benefits to illegal immigrants, including expanding eligibility for his 2012 amnesty for Dreamers and boosting the amount of time he was granting an amnesty form deportation and permits for legal work from two years to three years. While the administration hadn’t begun collecting applications under the expanded eligibility, it had awarded tens of thousands of three-year permits to applicants who had qualified as Dreamers under the original rules from 2012.”:::::::::::::::: [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the GOP fight to block President Obama’s executive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.]::::::::::::::::NOT JUST BIBI: PRESSURE GROWS TO NIX DEAL ON IRAN NUKES::::::::Reuters: “U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry flies to Riyadh this week to try to reassure King Salman that any nuclear deal with Iran will be in Saudi interests, despite the kingdom's fears that it may boost Tehran's backing for Shi'ite Muslim groups in the region. … While the main critics of the U.S. push for a nuclear deal with Iran are Israel and Congressional Republicans, Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia is also concerned that an accord would allow Iran to devote more cash and energy to Shi'ite proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, escalating conflicts. ‘The Saudis fear Obama will give the Iranians a deal whatever the cost because it is important for his legacy and that Iran will get a certain regional status in exchange for an agreement,’ said one diplomat in the Gulf.”::::::::::::::::Words that Hurt - “Mr. Kerry fancies himself a shrewd statesman on the global stage. But, in truth, history only remembers for his failure to beat former President George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election. Unless, of course, he strikes a deal with Iran that leads to the annihilation of Israel. Then he will finally be remembered for something else.” – Charles Hurt writing in his column for today.::::::::::::::::WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...::::::::If you start today, you could serve homemade corned beef on St. Patrick’s Day. Not only can you cure your “joint of beef” with whatever flavor ratios of coriander and allspice (or whatever else) you like, but you can also be sure that the meat itself is perfect: lean enough for good slicing and great sandwiches from leftovers and strong enough to deliver beefy flavor and handle a jaw-dropping 12-day brine. [Fox News First officially recommends the often-underestimated eye of round, but hey, it’s your pickled portion.] Corned beef is, of course, an American nod to our Irish roots not an Irish export. The recipe as we know it likely resulted from Irish immigrants using fresh, fatty cuts available here to replicate the taste of the lean, salted beef that would have been a luxury item for peasants over there. The result was a delicious cross-cultural phenomenon. How cross-cultural? This great recipe comes from renowned California butcher Aaron Rocchino.:::::::::::::::: Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The requested limit, confirmed by multiple people familiar with the amount, may mark the first time that a presidential hopeful has sought to hold off supporters from contributing too much money. The move reflects concerns among Bush advisers that accepting massive sums from a handful of uber-rich supporters could fuel a perception that the former governor is in their debt. The effort is also driven by a desire to build as broad a pool of donors as possible among wealthier contributors. …His potential rivals have acknowledged that they have little hope of matching his current pace.

NPR examined the history and evolution of knock-knock jokes, or as they were originally known, “do you know” jokes, e.g. “Do you know Arthur?” “Arthur who?” “Arthurmometer!” Pun haters at the start of the 20th century believed that such drivel couldn’t last. Not only did it last but intensified with the knock-knock format in the 1930s. Central Pennsylvania seems to have been the epicenter of the boom, with special credit belonging to radio station WKBO in Harrisburg, which marked the selection of Frank Knox as the 1936 Republican vice presidential nominee a day of the jokes. Get it? Knox-Knox. Clubs of knock-knock lovers, musical numbers and appearances in movie scripts followed as craze intensified, as did the corresponding loathing among sophisticates. In time, the jokes receded to being mostly kids’ stuff, as they provide a great formula for young jokesters who are learning about comedic timing.

"30709"	"2015-03-04"	"Hillary Clinton ran her own email servers as Secretary of State"	"The personal email address that Hillary Clinton used exclusively during her time as Secretary of State wasn't your typical Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account. Instead, Clinton operated her own email server traced to an internet service registered to the Clinton residence in Chappequa, New York, according to the Associated Press. The report does not say where the server itself was based. Clinton did not use an email address issued by the State Department while in office, which would have made it far simpler for the federal government to retain copies of her messages as is required under the Federal Records Act.::::::::Not your typical Gmail or Yahoo account::::::::Nor did Clinton use a personal Gmail or Microsoft account to conduct official state business, a move that's occasionally landed other US lawmakers in hot water. But even in those instances, politicians rarely use private accounts exclusively. With Clinton, everything went through her own private internet service, which in itself is sure to raise questions about how secure the email system was. How did encryption and other security mechanisms compare to what's offered by Google, Microsoft, or the federal government?::::::::In 2012, Clinton's email was reconfigured to use Google as a back end if the self-managed email system went down, the AP reported. (Just one year prior, Google publicly accused China of trying to hack into personal Gmail accounts belonging to senior members of US government, journalists, and other users.) Google was later replaced by MX Logic, an email provider that's now under McAfee.::::::::Clinton exclusively used the email address — hdr22@clintonemail.com — through the four years she served as state secretary under President Obama. During her tenure, ""aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers,"" The New York Times said Monday. But two months ago, Clinton's team gave 55,000 pages worth of emails to the State Department. It is unclear how advisors curated her inbox to decide which emails would be forwarded to the National Archives and which would not. A Clinton spokesperson said that because she so often corresponded with other federal officials through their government-provided accounts, Clinton had ""every expectation they would be retained"" for future reference.::::::::Clinton's predecessor, Colin Powell, used a personal email account in his communications with top officials both in the US and internationally. At that time, regulations around email preservation were much looser. Current Secretary of State John Kerry uses a government email address, ensuring his messages will be kept permanently. Clinton has not yet publicly discussed the issue or explained why a top-level cabinet member should be permitted to go it alone with a private email address. The State Department hasn't indicated that it's missing any emails from Clinton's tenure, but if not all of them have been handed over, requests to recover them in the future could run into Clinton's lawyers."
"30716"	"2015-03-04"	"Hillary Clinton's E-Mail Woes Aren't Going Away Soon"	"Here’s what we know.::::::::Late on Monday night, The New York Times revealed that Hillary Clinton exclusively used a personal e-mail address during her time as secretary of state. Clinton’s representatives defended the practice as in accordance with the law, though some archives and record-keeping experts disagreed.::::::::More information has come to light since the Times’s blockbuster report. Here’s what we now know about Clinton’s e-mail scandal.::::::::Clinton’s e-mail was run on a server based in her house. The Associated Press broke the news: the server for clintonemail.com, the domain Clinton and some top aides reportedly used, was registered at her home in Chappaqua, New York. Clinton’s own address was HDR22@clintonemail.com. (Clinton was born Hillary Diane Rodham.)::::::::Running what the A.P. called a “homebrew” system is generally risky, from a security standpoint. In November 2012, Clinton’s server was set to be backed up by Google servers. The A.P. found that the name Eric Hoteham associated with Clinton’s server. Hoteham’s name does not appear in any public records, though it is associated with other Clinton-centric domains such as presidentclinton.com and wjcoffice.com.::::::::She wasn’t the only one. Clinton’s aides, including top advisors Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines, also sometimes used personal e-mail addresses. The Clinton camp had defended Clinton’s use of personal e-mails by saying that those e-mails would be preserved on the side of the recipients. That would not be the case if, as former colleagues are telling reporters, those whom Clinton was corresponding with were also using non-government accounts.::::::::Potentially missing e-mails are the subject of multiple lawsuits and investigations. In addition to Congress’s Benghazi probe, there are a number of Clinton-related Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests that have resulted in curiously scarce findings. Media outlets (including The New York Times, Gawker, the Associated Press), and conservative groups such as Judicial Watch have complained that FOIA requests have either been ignored or been returned with a bafflingly small number of queries.::::::::Clinton once spoke of the difficulty of navigating “security restraints” around electronic communication. Here’s an excerpt from a 2011 interview with The Today Show: “For someone of my generation, I'm O.K. [with e-mail]. But, no, I have a lot of security restraints on what I can and can't do. But I do try to stay in touch as much as possible, and electronically is by far the easiest way to do that.”::::::::Republicans are, naturally, quite excited. Clinton has been seen as the Democrat’s likely nominee for president in 2016. This makes any scandal in the Clinton camp great news for Republicans, especially those who fancy themselves as future White House residents. Jeb Bush immediately tweeted about Clinton’s e-mails once the news broke, reminding the public that he had already posted a large cache of his e-mails from his time as governor of Florida online. Carly Fiona, a former Hewlitt-Packard C.E.O. who might also run as a Republican in 2016, also criticized Clinton for the e-mails. Politico has a solid rundown of the G.O.P. response thus far.::::::::Clinton has yet to speak on the matter. While a representative for Clinton gave initial comment to the Times and a number of aides and supporters have spoken off the record to various outlets, Clinton has yet to address the topic. She gave a speech Tuesday night to Emily’s List, a political action committee that works to elect women, but did not mention the still unfolding e-mail scandal.::::::::Sign up for Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour, our daily rundown of five stories worth discussing over drinks."
"30722"	"2015-03-04"	"Hillary Clinton e-mail uproar: Who is the mysterious 'Eric Hoteham'?"	"Reporters have traced Hillary Clinton's computer infrastructure to 'Eric Hoteham,' who is listed in Internet registration records as the customer at the Clinton house address.::::::::Russian Navy plans new supercarrier, but will it ever float?::::::::How extensive was Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of personal e-mail during her tenure as secretary of State? Let’s put it this way: She apparently had more than just a personal account. She had an entire personal e-mail system.::::::::That’s what the Associated Press is reporting, in any case. An AP investigation found that the computer server that handled Mrs. Clinton’s e-mail traced back to an Internet service registered to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.::::::::It’s unclear who ran this infrastructure, write AP reporters Jack Gillum and Ted Bridis. They traced it to a “mysterious entity, Eric Hoteham.” It’s possible this is a pseudonym, since the name doesn’t appear in any public databases.::::::::“Eric Hoteham” is listed as the customer at the Clinton house address in Internet registration records. On Wednesday, social media went nuts as self-appointed detectives tried to figure out whether Eric Hoteham was a real person or an anagram or some other symbolic combination.::::::::As the conservative website Twitchy quickly noted, the letters in the name can be rearranged into a number of other phrases, among them “oath crime, eh?” and “Hi come hater.”::::::::“What does ‘Eric Hoteham’ really mean? Twitter sleuths are on it!” Twitchy said.::::::::Wordplay aside, why would Clinton go so far as to rely on her own physical computers to handle her e-mail traffic? After all, she probably was not relaxing from the stress of being secretary of State by writing her own code.::::::::Well, more control is one obvious feature here. Her husband is an ex-president and she hopes to be one in the future. Over the decades, the Clintons may have decided they can rely only on themselves for security and discretion in communications. They’ve long felt under attack from what Mrs. Clinton once labeled a “vast right-wing conspiracy.”::::::::After all, Mr. Clinton’s affair with intern Monica Lewinsky became a matter of public concern almost by accident, as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr learned of the relationship while investigating other matters, including the Clintons' involvement in the failed Whitewater land deal in Arkansas.::::::::But this example also points out the obvious negative implication for Clinton of the e-mail system revelation. It could easily be interpreted as evidence she has something to hide. That’s certainly how Clinton’s critics on the right see it.::::::::“Every American understands plainly what conditions might lead someone to conduct official business on a private email account that is free from oversight, and none of them are virtuous,” writes Hot Air’s Noah Rothman.::::::::The legal ramifications of Clinton’s personal e-mail use aren’t clear. It’s possible that relevant rules and regulations weren’t in place until shortly before the end of her tenure at Foggy Bottom, or even after. That’s what defenders of her use of her own system say.::::::::“At the time Clinton was Secretary, the Federal Records Act didn’t require federal employees to use government accounts, only to preserve records of their communications. This, Clinton seems to have done,” writes Michael Tomasky in The Daily Beast.::::::::But at the least, Clinton will be drawn into lengthy litigation as reporters, advocacy groups, and lawmakers question whether she has turned over relevant records pursuant to Freedom of Information Act requests and congressional inquiries.::::::::That said, Ezra Klein at Vox has an interesting point about this potential mess. Clinton’s personal e-mail system is just a more organized method of avoiding transparency than the methods used by other Washington politicians, he says.::::::::If people have something sensitive to say in D.C., they don’t put it in an e-mail. They call. If they don’t want their phone records subpoenaed, they arrange a meeting. If they don’t want the meeting to show up in official logbooks, they make sure it’s not on the grounds of the White House or other government buildings.::::::::“Clinton deserves the opprobrium she’s getting. But she’s just an extreme example of a widespread problem,” writes Mr. Klein."

"30744"	"2015-03-04"	"Hillary Clinton Had Own Computer Server for Official Emails"	"The email practices of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who used a private account exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state, grew more intriguing with the disclosure Wednesday that the computer server she used traced back to her family's New York home, according to Internet records reviewed by The Associated Press.::::::::The unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official running her own email server would have given Clinton — who is expected to run for president in the 2016 campaign — significant control over limiting access to her message archives.::::::::It also would complicate the State Department's legal responsibilities in finding and turning over official emails in response to any investigations, lawsuits or public records requests. The department would be the position of accepting Clinton's assurances she was surrendering everything required that was in her control.::::::::The White House said it was Clinton's responsibility to make sure any emails about official business weren't deleted from her private server.::::::::""There's a responsibility that's associated with that, which is it's important to ensure that when official business is conducted on personal email, that those records are properly maintained and preserved,"" spokesman Josh Earnest said. He added there was no security review planned for Clinton's email server.::::::::The AP said Wednesday it was considering taking legal action against the State Department for failing to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat after waiting more than one year. The department has failed to meet several self-imposed deadlines but has never suggested that it doesn't possess all Clinton's emails.::::::::It was not immediately clear exactly where Clinton's computer server was run, but a business record for the Internet connection it used was registered under the home address for her residence in Chappaqua, New York, as early as August 2010. The customer was listed as Eric Hoteham.::::::::An aide to then-first lady Clinton was identified in a 2002 congressional report as Eric Hothem, whose name is spelled differently than in the Internet records. Hothem was not available to take a phone call when reached at his office Wednesday.::::::::A parody Twitter account for Hoteham appeared Wednesday after the AP cited the records, sending satirical tweets supporting Clinton's campaign. Hoteham's name had not appeared with that spelling in public-record databases, campaign contribution records or online background searches.::::::::In most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands.::::::::Clinton — who emailed so frequently using her Blackberry as secretary of state that it became an Internet meme — is particularly sensitive about disclosures of personal files based on her experiences in confronting congressional investigations and civil lawsuits during her husband's election and presidency and her own roles as first lady, senator, presidential candidate and Cabinet official."
"30747"	"2015-03-04"	"Why did Hillary Clinton rely on 'home-brew' e-mail server?"	"Reporters found that the computer server that handled Hillary Clinton’s e-mail during her tenure as secretary of State traced back to an Internet service registered to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.::::::::Russian Navy plans new supercarrier, but will it ever float?::::::::McDonald's cuts back on antibiotics in chicken. Why more restaurants will follow.::::::::How extensive was Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of personal e-mail during her tenure as secretary of State? Let’s put it this way: She apparently had more than just a personal account. She had an entire personal e-mail system.::::::::That’s what the Associated Press is reporting, in any case. An AP investigation found that the computer server that handled Mrs. Clinton’s e-mail traced back to an Internet service registered to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.::::::::It’s unclear who ran this infrastructure, write AP reporters Jack Gillum and Ted Bridis. They traced it to a “mysterious entity, Eric Hoteham.” It’s possible this is a pseudonym, since the name doesn’t appear in any public databases.::::::::“Eric Hoteham” is listed as the customer at the Clinton house address in Internet registration records. On Wednesday, social media went nuts as self-appointed detectives tried to figure out whether Eric Hoteham was a real person or an anagram or some other symbolic combination.::::::::As the conservative website Twitchy quickly noted, the letters in the name can be rearranged into a number of other phrases, among them “oath crime, eh?” and “Hi come hater.”::::::::“What does ‘Eric Hoteham’ really mean? Twitter sleuths are on it!” Twitchy said.::::::::Wordplay aside, why would Clinton go so far as to rely on her own physical computers to handle her e-mail traffic? After all, she probably was not relaxing from the stress of being secretary of State by writing her own code.::::::::Well, more control is one obvious feature here. Her husband is an ex-president and she hopes to be one in the future. Over the decades, the Clintons may have decided they can rely only on themselves for security and discretion in communications. They’ve long felt under attack from what Mrs. Clinton once labeled a “vast right-wing conspiracy.”::::::::After all, Mr. Clinton’s affair with intern Monica Lewinsky became a matter of public concern almost by accident, as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr learned of the relationship while investigating other matters, including the Clintons' involvement in the failed Whitewater land deal in Arkansas.::::::::But this example also points out the obvious negative implication for Clinton of the e-mail system revelation. It could easily be interpreted as evidence she has something to hide. That’s certainly how Clinton’s critics on the right see it.::::::::“Every American understands plainly what conditions might lead someone to conduct official business on a private email account that is free from oversight, and none of them are virtuous,” writes Hot Air’s Noah Rothman.::::::::The legal ramifications of Clinton’s personal e-mail use aren’t clear. It’s possible that relevant rules and regulations weren’t in place until shortly before the end of her tenure at Foggy Bottom, or even after. That’s what defenders of her use of her own system say.::::::::“At the time Clinton was Secretary, the Federal Records Act didn’t require federal employees to use government accounts, only to preserve records of their communications. This, Clinton seems to have done,” writes Michael Tomasky in The Daily Beast.::::::::But at the least, Clinton will be drawn into lengthy litigation as reporters, advocacy groups, and lawmakers question whether she has turned over relevant records pursuant to Freedom of Information Act requests and congressional inquiries.::::::::That said, Ezra Klein at Vox has an interesting point about this potential mess. Clinton’s personal e-mail system is just a more organized method of avoiding transparency than the methods used by other Washington politicians, he says.::::::::If people have something sensitive to say in D.C., they don’t put it in an e-mail. They call. If they don’t want their phone records subpoenaed, they arrange a meeting. If they don’t want the meeting to show up in official logbooks, they make sure it’s not on the grounds of the White House or other government buildings.::::::::“Clinton deserves the opprobrium she’s getting. But she’s just an extreme example of a widespread problem,” writes Mr. Klein."
"30756"	"2015-03-04"	"Everything We Know About Hillary Clinton's Email"	"The new political headache afflicting Hillary Clinton is all about email.::::::::The New York Times reported Monday that the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate had exclusively used a private email account for her government business during her tenure as Secretary of State, rather than a government email account. And an Associated Press report Wednesday said Clinton used her own email servers, rather than a third-party provider like Gmail or Yahoo Mail. That’s raised questions about whether Clinton was making a deliberate attempt to prevent her messages from being disclosed by open records requests or subpoenas.::::::::Clinton’s campaign has said she followed both “letter and spirit of the rules,” but the snafu has played into Republican criticisms of her as secretive and politically calculating.::::::::Here’s everything to know about controversy.::::::::A top U.S. diplomat working only on a personal email account raises an obvious question: Did Clinton stay off government email to hide something? Federal regulations are meant to prevent a situation in which officials, by keeping emails “off the record,” could thwart information requests made by the public or the government. When Clinton took office in 2009, federal rules required that government employees using a non-government email account “must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.” (It was only last year, one year after Clinton’s tenure had ended, that President Obama signed a explicitly limiting U.S. officials’ use of private email accounts for business matters.) But Clinton aides are the only ones who have determined what amounts to official correspondence and what doesn’t, and others might come to different conclusions.::::::::Probably not, but we’re still in a legal grey area. The Federal Records Act—passed in November, after Clinton left the State Department—requires government officials’ emails that are sent from personal account to be forwarded to an official account within 20 days. But during Clinton’s tenure, it was never explicitly required that top-level officials like Clinton use government-issued accounts. “What she did was not technically illegal,” Patrice McDermott, a former National Archives staffer and the head of the transparency group Open The Government coalition, told The Hill newspaper. But, she said, “it was highly inappropriate and it was inappropriate for the State Department to let this happen.”::::::::Because her official emails were sequestered on her private email address, much of her correspondence was not openly available via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which gives the public right to access information from the federal government.::::::::Will we ever see Clinton’s official emails? Or have they simply disappeared?::::::::Clinton’s team turned more than 50,000 pages of emails from her personal email account to the State Department late last year, when the Federal Records Act was passed, at the department’s request.::::::::How do we know that she turned over all required emails?::::::::We don’t. For several years, media outlets have filed requests for Clinton’s official correspondences during her tenure under FOIA. These requests have remained unreturned or unfulfilled, though the State Department has acknowledged their receipt. Theoretically, all of Clinton’s emails concerning government matters during her tenure fall under FOIA’s domain—but they are inaccessible if they were sent between Clinton’s private account and a third-party agency, such as a nonprofit foundation or a private consultancy. Clinton would need to provide these emails herself.::::::::Have other U.S. officials used private email accounts?::::::::Yes. Several officials in the Bush Administration, such as Karl Rove, were heavily criticized for using political e-mail accounts to send emails from the White House. While Clinton herself has not commented on the situation, Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, noted that former Secretaries of State in both parties had also used their own email accounts when engaging with U.S. officials.::::::::We don’t know. There haven’t been reports outlining specific repercussions against those officials who used private accounts for business emails. The White House has repeatedly made its e-mail policy clear each time the issue arises. “Very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees in the Obama administration should use their official e-mail accounts when they’re conducting official government business,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday.::::::::How much do high-ranking officials like Clinton really use email?::::::::It varies. Janet Napolitano, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, was known for never using email at all. It’s unclear exactly how often Clinton emailed, but certainly enough for her team to turn over 50,000 pages worth of emails. During her time as Secretary of State she was often spotted looking down at her BlackBerry—the image of her doing so in sunglasses inspired a Texts from Hillary meme.::::::::So what Internet service did she use?::::::::Clinton used a private email server registered back to her family’s home in Chappaqua, N.Y., the AP reports. That means she or someone working for her physically ran her own email, giving her wide-ranging control over her message archives. It also could have made her mails more vulnerable to hackers or physical disasters like fires or floods. The Secret Service would have been able to protect an email server in Clinton’s home from physical theft, however.::::::::Clinton reconfigured her email account in November 2012 to use Google servers as a backup . Five months after she resigned as Secretary of State, her email server was reconfigured again, switching her backup provider to a Denver-based email provider called MX Logic.::::::::Eric Hoteham is the mysterious name associated with Clinton’s private server account. But no public records of “Eric Hoteham” appear to exist, and the name wasn’t found in campaign contribution records or elsewhere, the AP reports.::::::::What email address did she use?::::::::One of her private email addresses was hrd22@clintonemail.com. HRD appears to stand for her premarital initials (Hillary Diane Rodham, as opposed to now Hillary Rodham Clinton). But it’s unclear what the 22 is for."
"30763"	"2015-03-04"	"Clinton facing mounting questions over efforts to stay off gov't email system"	"New revelations regarding Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email system while secretary of state are stoking mounting questions over why she went to such lengths to keep her messages off the official government system, as the White House on Wednesday refused to say whether she exercised poor judgment.::::::::White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, peppered with questions on the controversy for the second day in a row, told reporters it was ""clear that Secretary Clinton's team has gone to great lengths"" to collect and turn over emails and said Clinton's actions seemed consistent with the Federal Records Act.::::::::But he also reiterated that the administration gave ""very specific guidance"" that employees should use official accounts when conducting government business. Clinton did not do that. The New York Times first reported that she used a personal email account on a non-government server to conduct State Department business.::::::::A subsequent Times report noted this practice allowed her to shield some messages from investigators and the public. The Associated Press also reported she was operating on an Internet service registered to her family home in New York.::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who heads the special House committee investigating the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, said he and other panel members knew Clinton conducted some official business on a private email account but did not know she conducted all of her official business on it. He's now pursuing more records.::::::::""These are public records, and we should be able to access them,"" he told Fox News on Wednesday.::::::::The Washington Post reported Wednesday afternoon that Gowdy's panel is preparing to send subpoenas to the State Department. Gowdy stopped short of committing to that step in an interview with Fox News, but said they would use every tool at their disposal to get all the documents. He said they could pursue a subpoena ""in short order.""::::::::So far, Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of emails. Of that number, 300 of them are related to Benghazi.::::::::“The fact is, the State Department cannot certify that they produced all of Secretary Clinton’s emails because they do not have all of former Secretary Clinton’s emails nor do they control access to them,” Gowdy said during a press conference Tuesday.::::::::The email controversy is raising new credibility issues for Clinton going into the 2016 presidential race. Clinton has not officially confirmed a run, but she is widely expected to enter, and be the Democratic front-runner.::::::::The White House has deferred to the State Department on whether any laws were broken. While Earnest said employees are supposed to use official accounts, he clarified “when there are situations where personal email accounts are used, it is important for those records to be preserved, consistent with the Federal Records Act.”::::::::The practice, however, could in the short term complicate records requests.::::::::Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton claims Clinton’s use of a personal email account to conduct official business “may impact nearly a dozen of our Freedom of Information Act lawsuits now active in federal courts as well as dozens of pending FOIA requests.”::::::::The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a watchdog group, says it “intends to pursue every legal option” to obtain Clinton’s correspondence conducted while she was a senior member of President Obama’s administration.::::::::Matthew G. Whitaker, a former U.S. Attorney in Iowa and the executive director for the Washington-based group, said his organization plans to file a FOIA as well as a request with the attorney general’s office to retrieve all State Department records, including Clinton’s emails.::::::::“We will not rest until transparency has been achieved and proper disciplinary consequences, if warranted, are rendered,” Whitaker said in a written statement.::::::::Clinton representatives, though, have defended the former secretary of state. One Clinton aide told Fox News she was not bucking the system, and in fact was keeping with what former secretaries of state had done, including Colin Powell. The aide stressed that Clinton quickly responded to the request from the department for her emails, following updated guidance from the government's central records office.::::::::In the latest detail to emerge, the Associated Press reported overnight that the computer server that transmitted and received Clinton's emails -- on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state -- traced back to an Internet service registered to her family's home in Chappaqua, New York.::::::::The highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Clinton impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. It also would distinguish Clinton's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc.::::::::Most Internet users rely on professional outside companies, such as Google Inc. or their own employers, for the behind-the-scenes complexities of managing their email communications. Government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work.::::::::In most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands.::::::::Clinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account -- hdr22(at)clintonemail.com, which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym -- for official State Department business.::::::::Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. And since the Secret Service was guarding Clinton's home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking.::::::::Fox News' Chad Pergram, Doug McKelway and James Rosen and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Hothem, a financial adviser in Washington, was a special assistant to Clinton as far back as 1997 and considered one of the family’s information technology experts.::::::::Hothem surfaced in at least two Clinton administration controversies. A congressional report in 2002 investigating pardons said a Citibank account linked to Hothem wired $15,000 to President Clinton’s brother, Roger, in March 2001, while investigators were trying to compel Roger Clinton to testify about his role in several pardon cases.::::::::In early 2001, Hothem was also named by a former White House chief usher as saying the Clintons were permitted to take furniture when they left the White House that later was determined to belong to the government.::::::::The news of the personal email account and private server rocked Clinton’s glide to the 2016 Democratic nomination.

Obtaining an account from that domain became a symbol of status within the family’s inner circle, conferring prestige and closeness to the secretary.::::::::Chelsea Clinton was given one, but under a pseudonym, Diane Reynolds, which she frequently used when she checked into hotels. Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton’s longtime aide and surrogate daughter, was also given a coveted clintonemail.com address.::::::::And Mrs. Clinton used this private address for everything — from State Department matters to planning her daughter’s wedding and issues related to the family’s sprawling philanthropic foundation.::::::::Six years later, as Mrs. Clinton prepares for a 2016 presidential campaign, her exclusive use of her clintonemail.com address while secretary of state has set off intense criticism, because it shielded her correspondence from being searched in response to public records requests at the State Department. The practice has also raised questions about whether Mrs. Clinton’s private email was vulnerable to security risks and hacking.::::::::At the request of the State Department, Mrs. Clinton turned over about 50,000 pages of emails from clintonemail.com related to the government issues late last year. But her aides have declined to describe the process by which they selected which emails to hand over and which to hold back, and public records experts have expressed alarm that Mrs. Clinton’s correspondence was not being preserved as part of the State Department record-keeping system while she was in office.::::::::Late Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said in a Twitter message that she had asked the State Department to release her emails and that they would review them for release as soon as possible. “I want the public to see my email,” she wrote.::::::::“It seems her intent was to create a system where she could personally manage access to her communications,” said John Wonderlich, policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit organization that advocates transparency in government.::::::::“Given all the power she had as secretary of state, a lot of that work would be jumbled together,” Mr. Wonderlich said. “Her presidential ambitions and the family foundation would be wrapped up technically in email.”::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s allies have maintained that she followed protocol in the use of a private email address. A spokesman declined to elaborate on Wednesday about her use of clintonemail.com for matters related to the Clinton Foundation, which has received millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments. The foundation ceased to accept most donations from foreign countries while Mrs. Clinton was at the State Department but began the practice again after she left office in February 2013.::::::::In an email of talking points to supporters, Burns Strider, a senior adviser to Correct the Record, a group that defends Mrs. Clinton in the news media, pointed out that former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, also a likely 2016 presidential candidate, also hosts his own personal email server.::::::::Mr. Bush is a prolific user of email who continued to use his personal jeb.org domain, which his aides could also access, while he was in the governor’s office, said Kristy Campbell, Mr. Bush’s spokeswoman. Under Florida’s records laws, emails from Mr. Bush’s personal account have been made public. “His emails were available via public records requests throughout his time in office and have remained available,” Ms. Campbell said.::::::::In earlier years, Mrs. Clinton’s account at clintonemail.com was connected to a server registered to the Clintons’ Chappaqua home in the name of Eric P. Hothem. Mr. Hothem, a former aide to the Clintons, now works in finance in Washington, according to regulatory disclosure documents.::::::::Mr. Hothem, whose name was misspelled in Internet records, did not return a message left on Wednesday with an assistant at his office. Mr. Cooper, whose name is on the clintonemail.com domain registration, now works at Teneo Holdings, a corporate advisory firm with a broad array of global business clients partly run by Douglas J. Band, a former adviser to Bill Clinton.::::::::The Clintons eventually decided they did not want all three family members on the same email domain, in part, an adviser said, out of concern that it might look as if Mrs. Clinton’s official business at the State Department was too closely overlapping with Mr. Clinton’s work as a global philanthropist. Mr. Clinton stuck with presidentclinton.com, which was established in 2002. Chelsea Clinton has now set up chelseaoffice.com. The clintonemail.com domain is set to expire in 2017, when Mrs. Clinton, if successful in her presumptive campaign for president, would take office.::::::::In addition to concerns that Mrs. Clinton’s private emails are not subject to requests under the Freedom of Information Act, there are also questions about how secure her personal email address was as secretary of state.::::::::“She obviously would have been targeted when she stepped outside of the secure State Department networks,” said Tom Kellermann, a cybersecurity expert with Trend Micro. He said her use of her own email server instead of her government account, with its built-in security systems, would be akin to her leaving her bodyguard in a dangerous place. The unintended consequence, he said, is that Mrs. Clinton may have “undermined State Department security.”::::::::On Wednesday, a congressional committee examining the 2012 attacks in Benghazi sent a subpoena to Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers for all of her emails related to Libya. The committee sent the broad subpoena because it is seeking to determine whether Mrs. Clinton has handed over all of her correspondence about the attacks. Three weeks ago, the State Department provided the committee with roughly 900 pages of emails that the department said had come from her personal account. The committee also sent letters to Internet firms, telling them they were legally obligated “to protect all relevant documents” related to the Benghazi attacks."

They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.”::::::::Instead of releasing the emails — which total 50,000 pages — on her own, Mrs. Clinton asked the State Department to do so, so that it can review them to determine whether parts should be redacted because they contain information that could be damaging to national security. That process could take several weeks.::::::::In a statement, the State Department said it “will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the department, using a normal process that guides such releases.”::::::::“We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete,” the statement read.::::::::The announcement came two days after The New York Times reported that Mrs. Clinton did not have a government email address when she was secretary of state and that she had exclusively used a personal one to conduct all of her government business.::::::::The report raised questions about whether Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, violated National Archives and Records Administration rules and regulations that said agencies “must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.”::::::::The emails from Mrs. Clinton’s account were kept on private servers, shielding them from congressional and Freedom of Information Act requests for at least 18 months after she left office, if not longer. It was only after the State Department asked Mrs. Clinton in October for emails on her personal account related to her work in office that she turned them over.::::::::Three weeks ago, roughly 900 of the emails were turned over to a specially appointed House committee investigating the 2012 attacks on American outposts in Benghazi.::::::::Discussions between Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers and State Department officials about releasing the emails began on Tuesday, and the agreement was finalized on Wednesday.::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s Twitter message came after days of criticism that did not seem to be dissipating, despite pushback from allies who argued that former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and other potential 2016 Republican candidates had also maintained work-related email on private servers.::::::::On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton accepted an award from Emily’s List, a political action committee that seeks to elect female Democrats, but her lengthy remarks about the advancement of women and girls were overshadowed by lingering questions about the emails.::::::::People close to Mrs. Clinton foresaw a drawn-out controversy that would not subside until she made a public statement. Since establishing her Twitter account in June 2013, featuring a black-and-white photo of herself using a BlackBerry aboard a military C-17, Mrs. Clinton has used the medium to comment on events, whether debates over the vaccination of children or President Obama’s State of the Union address.::::::::Mrs. Clinton is assembling a 2016 presidential campaign that is expected to rethink her operation’s dealings with the news media, which have been a contentious subject in recent days as The Associated Press moved forward with legal action to have its Freedom of Information Act requests to the State Department fulfilled."
"30891"	"2015-03-05"	"Hillary Clinton: 'I Want the Public to See My Email'"	"The revelation that Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email address during her time as secretary of state, and set up her own server linked to her home address in Chappaqua, New York left many with the impression that she really didn't want anyone rifling through her emails. The setup allowed Clinton to keep her correspondence out of government archives and away from those who filed Freedom of Information Act requests – however, in her first public comment on the matter, she claimed that wasn't her intent. ""I want the public to see my email,"" she tweeted late on Wednesday night. ""I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.""::::::::A Clinton spokesman had no comment on the tweet, and referred questions about the release process to the State Department. Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf put together this statement after midnight:::::::::A House committee investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi is aiding Clinton in her new quest for transparency. On Wednesday the panel issued subpoenas for all Benghazi-related emails from Clinton and other State Department employees. (Gawker has alleged that top aides used clintonemail.com addresses while conducting State Department business, and the New York Times reports that, ""Obtaining an account from that domain became a symbol of status within the family’s inner circle, conferring prestige and closeness to the secretary."")::::::::The panel already received 300 of Clinton's emails, which were culled from the 55,000 pages of email records that the former secretary gave the State Department two months ago. Representative Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman, argued that they don't know if they have all of the relevant documents, since Clinton's team chose which emails to turn over for archiving. ""The fact is the State Department cannot certify that they have produced all of former Secretary Clinton’s emails because they do not have all of former Secretary Clinton’s emails, nor do they control access to them,"" he said.::::::::Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel, countered that his Republican colleagues are just fishing for information. ""Everything I've seen so far has led me to believe that this an effort to go after Hillary Clinton, period,"" he said.::::::::But they're not the only ones taking legal action over Clinton's email. Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday demanding Clinton's communications with the wife of ousted Egyptian president Muhammad Morsi. They said the State Department failed to comply with their previous FOIA requests for the documents.::::::::The Associated Press is also considering legal action after a number of its FOIA requests over the past few years went unanswered. ""We believe it’s critically important that government officials and agencies be held accountable to the voters,"" said the AP's general counsel, Karen Kaiser.::::::::::::::::Presumably, Clinton is eager to make all of these documents public, and to smooth over relations with the press – which is why she promptly addressed their inquiries about the email scandal with a single tweet posted in the middle of the night."

The practice is a potential violation of federal law, and has also raised questions of why Clinton went to such lengths to keep her messages off government servers.::::::::The Times reported that members of the Benghazi committee initially discovered that Clinton had used a private e-mail account during her tenure at Foggy Bottom. The paper also said that Clinton had turned over 55,000 messages that had been selected by her advisers to the State Department in response to a records request. Clinton's Twitter post appeared to refer to those messages, about 300 of which are related to the Benghazi attack.::::::::On Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that the server Clinton used to store her emails had been traced to an Internet service registered to the Clintons' home address in Chappaqua, N.Y. That maneuver would have given additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails.::::::::Meanwhile, the AP said it was considering legal action under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act against the State Department for failing to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat after waiting more than one year. The department has never suggested that it doesn't possess all Clinton's emails.::::::::The controversy has also raised new questions about Clinton's credibility as a presidential candidate. Though she has not formally declared her intention to run, Clinton is widely considered to be the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination.::::::::Clinton still has not described her motivation for using a private email account -- hdr22(at)clintonemail.com, which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym -- for official State Department business. However, a Clinton aide told Fox News she was not bucking the system, and in fact was keeping with what former secretaries of state had done, including Colin Powell. The aide stressed that Clinton quickly responded to the request from the department for her emails, following updated guidance from the government's central records office.::::::::The White House has deferred the question of whether any laws were broken to the State Department. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday it was ""clear that Secretary Clinton's team has gone to great lengths"" to collect and turn over emails and said Clinton's actions seemed consistent with the Federal Records Act.::::::::But he also reiterated that the administration gave ""very specific guidance"" that employees should use official accounts when conducting government business, which Clinton did not do.

Many aspects of Gration's leadership style were called into question -- including an apparent habit of ""publicly berating"" staffers and personally ""attacking"" them -- but a central issue was his handling of the computer and email systems.::::::::""He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business,"" the 2012 IG report said.::::::::The report urged the Nairobi embassy to ""cease using commercial email to process Department information and use authorized Department automated information systems for conducting official business.""::::::::The findings have taken on new relevance in the wake of the controversy over Clinton's email and Internet practices.::::::::The New York Times first reported that Clinton relied on personal email while secretary of state, a practice that contradicted administration guidance to use official accounts for government business. The Associated Press also reported that Clinton's computer server was traced to an Internet service registered to her family home in New York.::::::::Clinton turned over emails when the department asked for them, and she now says she's asked the department to make her communications public. Clinton representatives have defended the former secretary of state, saying she was not bucking the system and quickly responded to the department's request to submit old emails, following updated guidance from the government's central records office.::::::::But the IG report on Gration, initially flagged by The Weekly Standard, makes clear the department frowned on using unofficial systems.::::::::The August 2012 report said the ambassador, soon after arriving in May 2011, ""ordered a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system.""::::::::He also ""drafted and distributed a mission policy authorizing himself and other mission personnel to use commercial email for daily communication of official government business.""::::::::The report suggests Gration took a confrontational approach when making these changes -- according to the report, he ""broadcast his lack of confidence in the information management staff"" before taking ""charge"" of those operations. It also makes clear his changes allowed -- even required -- others to use commercial email as well.::::::::Clinton has not been accused of going so far, or of clashing with the information management team.::::::::But the report underscores why the department prefers officials to stay on the government system. The inspector general's office said the email system ""provides automatic security, record-keeping, and backup functions as required.""::::::::The report alleged: ""The Ambassador's requirements for use of commercial email in the office and his flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy have placed the information management staff in a conundrum: balancing the desire to be responsive to their mission leader and the need to adhere to Department regulations and government information security standards.""::::::::The report also said his government laptop was not connected to the official ""OpenNet network.""

The account raises questions -- even from within her party -- about transparency, security in the government and her future.::::::::While the Clintons have plenty of allies, some on the left are using this opportunity as a sign to flag that the Democrats' front-runner in the 2016 campaign might still face some of the same organizational challenges and public relations gaffes her campaign had eight years ago.::::::::As the story continues, here's a look at what you need to know.::::::::Late Wednesday night, Clinton made her first public comments regarding the use of a private email server as opposed to a State Department one.::::::::Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said the agency would review Clinton's request.::::::::""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases,"" Harf said. ""We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete.""::::::::A senior State Department official said on Thursday the department expects the review of Clinton's emails to ""take several months.""::::::::Clinton tried to avoid the controversy. On Tuesday night the former secretary of state delivered a much-watched speech in Washington, but did not mention her emails, instead focusing on politics and teasing her likely presidential run.::::::::After the State Department requested all secretaries of state send in their documents in 2014, Clinton and her team turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in December 2014. It is those emails that the former secretary of state wants released to the public.::::::::But because the emails were housed on her private account, the process was overseen by Clinton and her aides, not archivists like it would have been if the email was housed on government servers.::::::::A Clinton aide said that ""anything that pertained to her work there"" was given to State.::::::::""So if she emailed with her daughter about flower arrangements for her wedding, that didn't go in,"" the aide said, ""but if she emailed one of the 100 State Department officials she regularly corresponded with, State had it in their servers already and HRC's office replicated that to ensure it was all there.""::::::::The fact, though, that Clinton was in control of her own archives has concerned some archive and cybersecurity experts.::::::::The issue has grown from one focused on Clinton to something the White House has had to answer to, as well. Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the administration's policy ""allows individuals to use their personal e-mail address as long as those e-mails are maintained and sent to the State Department, which if you ask Secretary Clinton's team, that's what they completed in the last month or two.""::::::::A senior White House official told CNN on Thursday that aides to the President have been in touch with Clinton's staff ""to confirm facts and let them know what we planned to say.""::::::::Most Democrats don't want to talk about Clinton's email controversy. She is the party's prohibitive presidential favorite in 2016 and she leads every poll about the race, making it hard for other Democrats to draw her ire or knock her and risk hurting their party's best chance at keeping the White House.::::::::When CNN's Ted Barrett tried to ask congressional Democrats about the controversy, the responses were far from eager.::::::::""I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,"" said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who runs the Senate Democrats' campaign committee. ""Check back.""::::::::""I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,"" said North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.::::::::When CNN tried to ask Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who some liberals are hoping will challenge Clinton for the 2016 nomination, a staffer shielded her and deliberately blocked the senator from answering. Warren climbed into an elevator without looking up.::::::::Clinton supporters have vocally supported her. New York Rep. Steve Israel said, ""Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between.""::::::::But the email controversy has emboldened the wing of the Democratic party looking for a Clinton alternative in 2016.::::::::Some early primary state Democrats told CNN's Peter Hamby that the controversy shows the need for a competitive primary that will help vet Clinton for the general election.::::::::""The Democratic base that isn't wedded to her is nervous about it,"" said Deborah Arnie Arnesen, a progressive radio host in Concord, New Hampshire.::::::::""These are problems that raise real leadership and transparency concerns, concerns that can be addressed in caucuses and primaries, but would go ignored in a coronation process,"" said Boyd Brown, a Democratic National Committee member and former state legislator from South Carolina.::::::::The National Archives and Records Administration, the government agency that regulates the Federal Records Act, issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year Clinton took over at State -- that did not outlaw use of personal email accounts.::::::::""Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system,"" the regulations said. It is unclear if there was a time requirement for the preservation of the emails.::::::::Before 2009, according to Miriam Kleinman, spokeswoman for the National Archives, the agency did not ""specifically address this issue.""::::::::""But agencies have always had the responsibility to manage federal records created or received outside of agency systems, including email on nonofficial systems,"" she added.::::::::It wasn't until August 2013 -- after Clinton left State -- that the records administration issued a bulletin that personal email can only be used in ""emergency situations,"" and when used, the emails ""are captured and managed in accordance with agency record-keeping practices.""::::::::Late last year -- long after Clinton left the State Department -- President Barack Obama signed an update to the Federal Records Law to prohibit the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they copy or forward any such emails into their government account within 20 days.::::::::Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said on Tuesday that it doesn't appear Clinton violated the law because ""the Federal Records Act is amorphous enough.""::::::::Baron did say, however, that the exclusive use of a personal email system is out of the ordinary.::::::::""I was in the government for 34 years and in my experience, as director of litigation, I cannot recall an instance where a high-level official -- or anyone -- solely used a private email account for the transaction of government business,"" he said.::::::::The House select committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi issued subpoenas for Clinton's email on Wednesday.::::::::""The Select Committee on Benghazi today issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation,"" said Jamal Ware, the committee's communications director, in a statement. ""The committee also has issued preservation letters to Internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.""::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the committee, told CNN on Wednesday, before the subpoenas were announced, that he was willing to do whatever it took to get the documents.::::::::""We are going to use every bit of legal recourse at our disposal to make sure"" the committee gets all the documents, Gowdy said. If that requires ""sending legal resource to the secretary herself, that is what we are going to do.""::::::::Democrats on the committee said Wednesday that they received ""no notice"" from Gowdy that the committee was preparing subpoenas for Clinton's documents.::::::::""I did not want to believe it, but everything I've seen so far has led me to believe that this is an effort to go after Hillary Clinton. Period. And I think that's very very unfortunate,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the select committee.::::::::A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to CNN questions about the subpoenas, but Clinton's team has been in contact with the committee.::::::::After Gowdy said Clinton used multiple private email addresses at State, Clinton's lawyer David E. Kendall sent Republicans and Democrats on the House committee investigating Benghazi a statement on Wednesday morning refuting Gowdy's claim.::::::::""Secretary Clinton used one email account when corresponding with anyone, from department officials to friends to family,"" Kendall wrote in an email that explained how after Clinton's email address was published in a 2013 Gawker story, ""she changed the address on her account.""::::::::""At the time the emails were provided to the department last year this new address appeared on the copies as the 'sender,' and not the address she used as secretary,"" Kendall continued. ""This address on the account did not exist until March 2013, after her tenure as secretary.""::::::::Committee Republicans stood by Gowdy's claim, however, and reacted to Clinton's tweet about releasing her emails on Thursday.::::::::""The former secretary's tweet does not answer questions about why this was not done when she left office, the integrity of the emails while she controlled them, the scheme to conceal them, or the failure to provide them in logical course,"" said Jamal D. Ware, communications director for the Republicans on the committee. ""Legitimate investigations do not consider partial records.

"31046"	"2015-03-05"	"Clinton private email violated 'clear-cut' State Dept. rules"	"The State Department has had a policy in place since 2005 to warn officials against routine use of personal e-mail accounts for government work, a regulation in force during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state that appears to be at odds with her reliance on a private email for agency business, POLITICO has learned.::::::::The policy, detailed in a manual for agency employees, adds clarity to an issue at the center of a growing controversy over Clinton’s reliance on a private email account. Aides to Clinton, as well as State Department officials, have suggested that she did nothing inappropriate because of fuzzy guidelines and lack of specific rules on when and how official documents had to be preserved during her years as secretary.::::::::But the 2005 policy was described as one of several “clear cut” directives the agency’s own inspector general relied on to criticize the conduct of a U.S. ambassador who in 2012 was faulted for using email outside of the department’s official system.::::::::“It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized [Automated Information System], which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information,” the Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual states.::::::::Spokespeople for the State Department and Clinton stressed earlier this week that the agency had “no prohibition” on the use of private e-mail for work purposes.::::::::Clinton said in a tweet Wednesday night that she wants the public to be able to see the emails she has turned over to the State Department in December. But the agency said that a review process that includes seeing if the documents contain personal or classified information could take some time to complete.::::::::The 2005 policy says approved “telework solutions” satisfy the rule, which appears in a section of State Department regulations discussing “sensitive but unclassified” information — an extremely broad category of data. Former officials said a large volume of State Department paperwork and e-mail falls into the category known internally as “SBU.”::::::::The email policy gained some attention when the inspector general issued a scathing report on the tenure of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Scott Gration as U.S. ambassador to Kenya. The review, which led to his resignation three years ago, faulted him on a variety of grounds: one was having “a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system.”::::::::Another complaint the report leveled against Gration: “He drafted and distributed a mission policy authorizing himself and other mission personnel to use commercial email for daily communication of official government business.”::::::::A State official who asked not to be named noted that the email issue was just one of a series of serious management shortcomings described in the 2012 inspector general report about U.S. Embassy operations in Kenya.::::::::State Department officials and Clinton aides have offered no response to questions in recent days about how her private e-mail system was set up, what security measures it used, and whether anyone at the agency approved the arrangement. It’s unclear how such a system, run off an internet domain apparently purchased by the Clinton family, could have won approval if the department’s policies were as the inspector general’s report describes them.::::::::Clinton sent 55,000 pages of e-mails from her private account to the State Department in December, after State officials asked Clinton and other former secretaries to provide copies of any work-related e-mail messages so they could be incorporated into the agency’s official record systems.::::::::The former secretary said on Twitter Wednesday, “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” Clinton tweeted."
"31052"	"2015-03-05"	"Aide tied to past Clinton scandals surfaces in controversy over emails"	"A former aide to Hillary Clinton during her first lady years – who was tied to two earlier Clinton family political scandals -- has surfaced in connection to the mounting controversy over her Internet and email practices.::::::::Eric Paul Hothem, an aide in the Clinton White House, appears to have been listed as the registered owner of 'clintonemail.com' – a private server and email network Hillary Clinton relied on to conduct official government business while secretary of state.::::::::The Associated Press first reported that the account is hosted at the Clinton family’s Chappaqua, N.Y., home, and was registered to one “Eric Hoteham.”::::::::Neither Fox News nor the AP could find any evidence that an “Eric Hoteham” exists. But Eric Hothem, now a broker for J.P Morgan in Washington D.C., has a strikingly similar name – and deep ties to the Clintons’ checkered past. Neither he nor his wife Sue Hothem, a well-connected D.C. fundraiser who works as vice president of membership for TechNet, could be reached for comment Thursday.::::::::Eric Hothem’s name first surfaced as part of Clinton lore when, in 2001 as the first lady’s aide, he apparently was tied to the removal of several thousand dollars’ worth of furniture and gifts from The White House to the Clintons’ homes -- property the Park Service and White House Chief Usher Gary Walters maintained belonged to the White House.::::::::Barbara Olson, a well-known lawyer and conservative commentator who died in the 9/11 attacks, wrote about the controversy in her book, “The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House.” She noted some of the art items taken were part of a White House Americans Craft Collection.::::::::“The National Archives confirmed that the art pieces had been shipped to an Arkansas warehouse, and White House curator Betty Monkman said the decision to move them was made by ‘Mrs. Clinton herself,’” Olson wrote in her book, published after she died in the 2001 attack on the Pentagon.::::::::She wrote that in January 2000, the Clintons began shipping furniture to their Chappaqua home, “despite concerns raised by White House chief usher Gary Walters about whether they were entitled to remove the items. Walters rightly believed they were part of a $396,000 White House redecoration project in 1993.”::::::::According to Olson’s book, Hothem told Walters the items were the Clintons’ personal property.::::::::While the Clintons were forced to return some of the furnishings, and pay $86,000 for the gifts, “No one for sure knows how much the Clintons got away with,” Olson wrote.::::::::Hothem’s name also is associated with a second controversy, detailed in a 2002 House Government Reform Committee report, “Justice Undone, Clemency Decisions in the Clinton White House,” which examined President Clinton’s most controversial pardons and clemencies.::::::::As a part of its investigation, the committee looked into the finances of Bill Clinton’s brother, Roger Clinton, noting he received $335,000 in “unexplained travelers checks,” “purchased overseas and likely imported illegally.”::::::::But Roger Clinton also accepted a $15,000 transfer the president made to him from a Citibank account -- associated with Hothem – at the time the committee was trying to get Roger Clinton’s cooperation.::::::::“On March 23, 2001, while the committee was attempting to obtain the cooperation of Roger Clinton, he received a wire transfer of $15,000 from a Citibank account entitled ‘E.C. 934(A) c/o Eric Hothem. Eric Hothem was an aide to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,” the congressional report said.::::::::The report says that when contacted about the transfer, “Hothem’s lawyer referred the Committee to the President’s lawyer, David Kendall.”::::::::Kendall told the committee the account was a personal one of the Clintons and the money was a loan by the president to his brother for legal counsel.::::::::The committee said it was “unclear whether Roger Clinton has repaid or intends to repay the money” but noted “the payment occurred at the height of public outcry and investigative activity regarding pardons at a time when Roger Clinton was deciding whether to provide testimony to the committee and authorities in that Southern District of New York.”::::::::Hothem also was among several “friends and colleagues” Clinton credited in her autobiography as having checked facts, reviewed drafts and shared memories.::::::::It remains unclear what role, if any, Hothem might have played in setting up Clinton computer system. The revelation that she relied exclusively on private email, and used her own unique server, has raised transparency questions for the former secretary, who is widely expected to launch a 2016 presidential run.::::::::Clinton, though, announced late Wednesday via Twitter that she has asked the State Department to make public the emails she has turned over.::::::::""I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,"" she wrote.::::::::A Clinton spokesman could not be reached for comment on Thursday."

The message also said employees should not ""auto-forward Department email to personal email accounts which is prohibited by Department policy.”::::::::The cable underscores that government policy strongly discouraged officials from using personal email and violators faced disciplinary action, even though Clinton for years relied exclusively on hers – and her own server -- to conduct official business. The White House, without condemning Clinton’s activities, has made clear that employees were urged to use government accounts.::::::::The 2011 cable, bearing the subject line “Securing Personal E-mail Accounts,” told employees to secure personal/home email addresses, given increased targeting of government employees by “online adversaries.” It also emphasized that these personal accounts should never be used for government business and cited department procedures which prohibit the practices.::::::::The cited section from the Foreign Affairs Manual states: “It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS [the authorized department information system] which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information. … Employees should be aware that transmissions from the Department’s OpenNet to and from non-U.S. Government Internet addresses, and other .gov or .mil addresses, unless specifically directed through an approved secure means, traverse the Internet unencrypted.”::::::::In addition to the 2011 cable, a 2012 inspector general report chastised a former ambassador to Kenya for – among other issues – using commercial email to do official business. That ambassador, Scott Gration, resigned shortly before the scathing IG report was released.::::::::In 2013, the FBI raided the home of former CIA Director David Petraeus. Petraeus pleaded guilty this week to the improper storage of classified material, in this case keeping several black notebooks documenting his wartime career in an unlocked drawer. Fox News asked the bureau’s senior spokesman if they were concerned the servers at Clinton’s home might also contain classified information, and, therefore, were also improperly stored.::::::::Asked if they were “officially looking into the matter,” FBI spokeswoman Michael Kortan said: “We’re not.  You may want to check with State.”::::::::Fox News asked the State Department how the 2011 cable, sent under Clinton’s signature, was consistent with her own use of a personal email account, and there was no immediate response.::::::::Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"31122"	"2015-03-05"	"Lupica: Emails show Hillary Clinton can self-inflict woes"	"Somehow you get the idea, whether or not you were one of the extra special people with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email address, that Ms. Clinton’s most dangerous opponent if she wants to be President might still be Ms. Clinton herself.::::::::It would mean very little has changed since the Democratic primary process in 2008, when Barack Obama should have had no chance against her, or against a Clinton “machine” that we were told was the American political version of Special Forces, or even the Navy SEALs.::::::::Oh, she may end up winning the nomination going away this time, and may end up being the first woman President of this country. But in a week when we discover she did have her very own domain name — clintonmail.com — while serving as secretary of state, we are reminded at the same time how easy it is for something as simple as an email address to become a thing with Bill and Hillary Clinton. They remain the queen and king of things like this.::::::::It’s why anybody who thinks that she is a sure thing to become the next President, to beat Jeb Bush or Rand Paul or even a clown like Scott Walker, should probably think again. And ask why she will do better this time than she did when she and her people got taken to the cleaners by David Plouffe and David Axelrod, the geniuses who ran Obama’s campaign.::::::::The thunderdome of the bullhorn media will make this controversy about emails and domains more than it is, as if somehow this whole thing has turned into Benghazi II. They will do this even though the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks on our embassy in Benghazi absolutely has a reasonable right to now wonder if they have been given access to all relevant email correspondence from Ms. Clinton about those attacks.::::::::But that isn’t the reaction to all of this that is most interesting. What is most interesting is how quick people in this country are to believe, when one or both of the Clintons are making headlines again, that they still imagine themselves to be playing by different rules than everybody else, as if they remain the real royalty of current American political life, all this time after Bill Clinton left the White House and Hillary left with him.::::::::It is almost as interesting as people somehow assuming that a Hillary nomination and even a Hillary presidency are inevitable, as if she is finally the great candidate and truly great politician that her husband once was, even with the historic harm he did to himself because of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Only she is not.::::::::Hillary Clinton, who ran with the crowd in the runup to George W. Bush’s war in Iraq, was never a great or even memorable U.S. senator from New York. And frankly she was a wildly overrated secretary of state, even as Obama treated her like John Foster Dulles on her way out the door, unless you confuse job performance with the accumulation of an amazing number of frequent flier miles. But that hasn’t stopped her from being the odds-on favorite to win this nomination and win back the White House for her family.::::::::It certainly hasn’t stopped the momentum that has been building behind her and around her for months. Neither has the fact that she did about as well with her book tour last year as she did against Barack Obama.::::::::Perhaps this changes if some exciting Democrat comes out of nowhere and makes a run. All we know for sure right now is that this story about the emails is going to have legs. These stories always do when there is a Clinton around. Sometimes the name alone exhausts you, after all the time the two of them have had on the stage.::::::::On Thursday I pointed out to a New York Democrat who has watched the whole show with Hillary Clinton in this state that once again a dog has managed to eat a Clinton’s homework.::::::::“Yup,” the guy said. “This is a mess and it’s only going to get worse. She was using the server at the house? Really?”::::::::Of course if you put her up against the likes of Scott Walker, she looks like Joan of Arc. But it might not be as easy against Jeb Bush, if Bush is able to take his party back from the screamers and droolers and various nuts from the Tea Party, the ones who want to shut down Homeland Security because they don’t like Obama’s immigration policies. By the way? That happens to make the controversy about Hillary Clinton’s domain look small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.::::::::For now Mrs. Clinton says she wants the public to ""see"" her emails. It means the emails she chooses to let the public see. Her campaign hasn't officially started yet, but the games have already begun. LOL."

"Hillary Clinton has said she wants the pubic to see 55,000 e-mails she turned over to the State Department that had been kept in her personal, unofficial email account. But nobody should hold their breath waiting to see them. That’s because the State Department is legendary for taking forever to wade through and ultimately decide what documents can be released when.::::::::That may be why – even after Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters that agency officials would “undertake this task as rapidly as possible” – a State Department spokesman tamped down expectations, cautioning the process would be time-consuming given the volume of the record. That may also be why a senior State Department official told Reuters yesterday that “the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set.”::::::::And, the source might have added, given the State Department’s record.::::::::The record is so bad that, in 2014, the non-partisan Committee for Effective Government rated it last among major agencies in processing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.::::::::It’s so slow that the State Department’s Office of Inspector General, in a 2012 report, chastised the department’s Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS), which handles document requests, for being “prone to delay,” saying some FOIA requests had been outstanding for up to six years, with the average time to process any complex request being roughly a year.::::::::The Inspector General described a process worthy of the Victorian-era British Colonial Office, that “begins with IPS’s receiving and reviewing an incoming request. The request then goes to an analyst, who formulates a strategy to make the necessary searches, which can involve interacting with multiple domestic offices and overseas posts. Often, the Department’s bureaus do not make the request a high priority. After the bureau responds, the analyst packages the documents and sends them to a reviewer, who may remove some documents or suggest additional searches. The package then goes to another reviewer, who determines whether exemptions in FOIA or other statutes apply and makes any necessary redactions. Finally, the package goes back to the analyst, who assesses any fees for searches and copies. The analyst then sends the document with a cover letter to the requester.”::::::::Needless to say, for historians who research foreign relations, FOIA a nightmare. A survey of researchers undertaken in 2014 by the Society for Historians of Foreign Relations found that “at best,” the researchers “report an eight month to one year wait, but delays also range from two to four years, five to seven years, and longer. Some researchers report that requests are still pending after a decade or more. This has caused some researchers to give up, since they have finished their dissertations and books while still waiting for FOIA requests to be processed.”::::::::The stories about delays are the stuff of legend among media and watchdog groups in Washington as well.::::::::In 2007, the Center for Public Integrity requested documents from the State Department about political appointees serving as ambassadors. By 2011, the request was still unfulfilled. It received a letter from the State Department, the Center reported, saying it was “’undertaking a comprehensive effort’ to clear its backlog of requests and was thus writing to ‘inquire whether you are still interested in pursuing this case.’” The latter warned that “without a response within 45 days, the department will close the case and take no further action.”::::::::In March 2010, the Associated Press first submitted requests for information pertaining to a variety of issues involving the Hillary Clinton State Department, including her schedule and “her department’s decision to grant a special position for longtime aide Huma Abedin.” In December 2014, the AP reported it had been informed that the department would not finish the request at least until April. “The 4-year-old FOIA request still has no estimated completion date,” it reported.::::::::That’s nothing compared with the struggle, now in its 14th year, by the nonprofit National Security Archive to obtain some 1976 telephone conversation records involving Nixon administration Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Archive said it sued the State Department earlier this week in pursuit of the materials.::::::::So how long might the State Department take to plow through the Clinton e-mails, screening them for classified information, information about federal employees that might violate privacy laws, comments about foreign leaders that could compromise foreign relations and other assorted exemptions, of which there are nine broad categories.::::::::Could it take as long as it’s taken to get the Kissinger records?::::::::“My short answer is yes, it could take forever, if Kissinger’s telcons are any guide,” said Thomas S. Blanton, the National Security Archive’s director. On the other hand, he said in an e-mail to The Washington Post: “If you have a senior group of experienced folks with leverage behind them (statute, White House pressure, media pressure) they can review and release those 55,000 pages in a matter of a couple of months. … Our own experience, with hundreds of FOIA requests every year for 29 years at State, is that the line reviewers are way cautious, lots of unjustified withholding, but when we take the decision up a level, to the appeals panel, which is composed of ambassadors between assignments, we win release 75% of the time. Almost as if, these folks have already been confirmed by the Senate, they are willing to take command decisions, they see issues like classification and foreign leaders’ communications and personnel information as a matter of risk management, not zero tolerance. And they know the reality of massive over classification."
"31230"	"2015-03-06"	"Ousted ambassador sounds off on Hillary email flap"	"A former ambassador now entangled in the storm over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail account fired back at the State Department Friday, disputing claims that he made a determined effort to conduct official business via an e-mail system not under government control.::::::::In a lengthy e-mail to POLITICO and other news outlets, Scott Gration, a former Air Force general who served as ambassador to Kenya, brushed aside comparisons between his situation and Clinton’s. However, Gration acknowledged that his dismissal in 2012 — while Clinton was secretary — was due in part to the department’s resistance to his efforts to have easy access to his Gmail account while he served as the top U.S. diplomat in Nairobi.::::::::“My experience was somewhat different than Secretary Clinton’s use of her commercial account, yet I was ‘fired’ for the use of Gmail in the US Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations,” Gration wrote from Kenya, where he now works in the private sector. “I’ve chosen to move on and to be better, not bitter.”::::::::Gration portrayed his difficulties as largely a result of clashing with the State Department’s information technology bureaucracy, which he said resisted reasonable requests to enable easy access to his personal e-mail account during the work day.::::::::“It is true that I used my Gmail account to access my alerts and unclassified personal emails. I had subscribed to three ‘alerts’ programs that sent me breaking news stories, analysis of important events, and Africa-related articles…I use Gmail because these services were not available on the State Department’s OpenNet computer network,” the former ambassador wrote. “Over the years, I had also built a professional network that used my Gmail address. I wanted to have access to these capabilities and contacts while at work.”::::::::Gration did not explain why he could not re-direct alerts to his State.gov e-mail address. He did say that the State Department also bucked his attempts to access his personal account via his government Blackberry phone.::::::::“Soon after becoming Ambassador, I tried hard to have my unclassified State Department emails and my Gmail messages displayed as separate accounts on the same State Department Blackberry. I had done this on BlackBerries in the past to eliminate having to carry around two devices. After four months of trying, I gave up and used two Blackberries to read my unclassified email traffic that could easily and safely been displayed on one,” the former ambassador added.::::::::A scathing report issued by the State Department’s Inspector General in 2012 blasted Gration’s tour at the Nairobi embassy, calling his leadership “divisive and ineffective.” It also accused him of being reluctant to accept “clear-cut” decisions from Washington, including what inspectors said was a directive that officials not routinely use private e-mail account for work purposes.::::::::The technology-related issues constitute only a small part of the criticism leveled at Gration in the 2012 report, but they have come under close scrutiny this week as Clinton aides and State Department spokespeople insisted that the department had no clear policy on work-related use of personal e-mail until late last year.::::::::Clinton’s use of the personal e-mail account has led to claims that it was intended to shield her communications from Freedom of Information Act requests and perhaps from Congressional inquiries as well. Gration said his official messages were properly archived.::::::::“It is false that I ignored State Department instructions and willfully disregarded State Department regulations concerning the use of commercial email for official government business. I used the OpenNet for much of my official business as I had full access to this system in my US Embassy office and in my residence,” he said. “My official emails were fully captured in the State Department data bases. I used Gmail for unofficial business and for my personal emails.”::::::::The former ambassador did say that some “edicts” from State’s information technology leaders “didn’t make sense.” He said he could not send a message to a State.gov account from his own Gmail account, except in an emergency, but anyone that did not work for State could send messages from similarly configured accounts. He said he didn’t understand how those restrictions aided security.::::::::In the message to reporters Friday, Gration also sounded off on another topic that has become part of Clinton email flap: a category of State Department information known as “sensitive but unclassified” or “SBU.” He suggested State’s use of the broad label had become flabby and reflexive, avoiding making decisions about whether information merited no special protection or should be relegated to classified systems.::::::::“I realized that US Embassy personnel had to inadvertently violate the procedures as they were currently written,” the former ambassador said. He said he and a State security staffer drafted and sent to Washington a new post policy that “tightened up our procedures so sensitive documents were not compromised [and] caused authors to determine if their words were actually unclassified or should be put into our secure classified system.”::::::::“We’d been lulled into using SBU as a quasi-classification of information…which it was not,” Gration said.::::::::In December, Clinton returned 55,000 pages of work-related emails from her private account to the State Department after it wrote to several former secretaries asking for such records. Officials are now reviewing the messages to see if any contain “sensitive but unclassified” information that should not be made public.::::::::A State Department rule issued in 2005 said the agency had a “general policy” against routine use of private e-mail accounts for work purposes. The statement appears to reflect a broad rule for agency computer use, but it appears in a section of the Foreign Affairs Manual devoted to “sensitive but unclassified” information.::::::::A State Department official said Thursday night that the policy applied only to “SBU” information, not to other unclassified work-related information handled by State employees. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency was still reviewing whether the 55,000 pages of e-mails Clinton submitted contained SBU information."

(After all, Democrats' 2016 pickings beyond Clinton are quite slim.) And, no, the matter is unlikely to make her less of a viable general-election candidate. (If the Clintons are good at something, it's getting out of a jam.) But the controversy, we think, has created two lasting issues for her all-but-certain presidential campaign. One, it's already led to a new congressional Republican investigation, which could last for months. And here's the thing about fishing expeditions: You never know what you're going to catch. (Here's a video take from one of us on this very point.) Two, the episode has already revealed a pretty hostile relationship with the political press corps. Being a frontrunner means you get tough press, but there's a difference between getting tough press and getting NO benefit of the doubt from the media. And right now on this story, Clinton doesn't have the benefit of the doubt.::::::::On Saturday, President Obama will travel to Selma, AL to participate in events marking the 50th anniversary of the bloody march there that helped lead to passage of the Voting Rights Act. USA Today reminds us of Obama's visit there when he was a candidate running for president in 2007. ""Eight years ago, an up-and-coming black politician from Chicago talked about how he owed his career to bloodshed on a bridge in Selma, Ala. 'I'm here because somebody marched,' then-senator Barack Obama said in Selma that day. 'I'm here because you all sacrificed for me.' Now the first African-American president of the United States, Obama returns to Selma on Saturday along with thousands of others who have led very different lives because of what happened there 50 years ago."" More: ""Obama and others attending Selma events this weekend are expected to praise racial progress but also address many remaining challenges"" -- including what happened in Ferguson, MO last summer.::::::::John Lewis to appear on ""Meet the Press""::::::::Speaking of Selma, NBC's ""Meet the Press"" this Sunday will interview one of the heroes from the Selma march -- Rep. John Lewis (D-GA). Other guests will include Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), plus Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Curt Schilling on the coarsening of cultural and political rhetoric.::::::::When a cattle call is actually almost a real cattle call::::::::Saturday also brings us another 2016 GOP cattle call, and this time it's pretty much a literal cattle call - the 2015 Iowa Ag Summit, which is organized by agribusiness mega-donor Bruce Rastetter. As National Journal wrote last month: ""Outside of Iowa, Rastetter is virtually unknown.

"Hillary Clinton's State Department for years was telling underlings not to use personal email -- even ousting an ambassador, the ex-diplomat says, in part over his Gmail habits -- despite the secretary of state herself ignoring that advice.::::::::The disconnect is now raising questions of a double standard during her tenure.::::::::An internal 2011 State Department cable, obtained by Fox News, shows Clinton's office told employees not to use personal email for security reasons.::::::::A year later, then-U.S. ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration resigned amid a series of clashes with the department, including over email.::::::::""My experience was somewhat different than Secretary Clinton's use of her commercial account, yet I was 'fired' for the use of Gmail in the US Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations,"" Gration told FoxNews.com in an email Friday, while adding: ""I've chosen to move on and to be better, not bitter.""::::::::Gration's departure from the Obama administration was far more complicated than the matter of his email use -- he was cited for his allegedly aggressive management style and other infractions, though he disputes some of them. But a scathing inspector general report repeatedly censured him for his personal email practices -- underscoring how frowned upon the use of non-government systems was.::::::::In addition, Gration claims he only used Gmail ""for unofficial business and for my personal emails,"" and his official emails were ""fully captured in the State Department data bases.""::::::::By contrast, Clinton simply stayed off the government system and used personal email -- for virtually all business.::::::::She handed over thousands of emails when the State Department sought them after the fact, and now says she has asked the department to make them public. Her representatives say the ""letter and spirit of the rules"" allowed the use of non-government email if records were kept, and deny any effort to skirt the system.::::::::Based on publicly available policies and the 2012 inspector general report, however, this was not the standard applied to other officials. If nothing else, it raises transparency questions for Clinton that could hang over her political future as she nears a likely presidential run.::::::::Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., suggested Clinton was following a different standard, invoking her infamous quote before a congressional committee about the controversy over the origin of the 2012 Benghazi attack.::::::::""We're now starting to begin to see when she told Congress awhile back 'What difference does it make?' She wasn't talking about the four dead Americans in Benghazi, she was talking about herself,"" Pompeo told Fox News on Thursday. ""What difference does it make if you comply with the requirement to tell the American people everything you know? What difference does it make if you tell everyone in the State Department that they've got to have an official email account but you don't have one?""::::::::The 2011 State Department cable, sent to diplomatic and consular staff in June 2011 and bearing Clinton's electronic signature, made clear to employees they were expected to ""avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts."" The message also said employees should not ""auto-forward Department email to personal email accounts which is prohibited by Department policy.""::::::::It cited a section from the Foreign Affairs Manual, which states: ""It is the Department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS [the authorized department information system] which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information.""::::::::Gration, a former Air Force fighter pilot, offered an explanation for why he took issue with the department's cyber policies.::::::::For instance, he questioned why he was ""prohibited"" from sending a Gmail message to a State Department computer in most cases, since other official accounts used the ""same routers and security firewalls as a Gmail account.""::::::::He said he ultimately used that account to access personal emails and alerts, which were not available on the official system. He acknowledged some of the findings in the IG report but called others ""misleading"" and ""falsehoods."" He said it was ""false"" that he ""willfully disregarded"" the department's commercial email policies, since he used the official system for much of his government business.::::::::The wide-ranging report included myriad accusations about his management style -- including an alleged practice of ""publicly berating"" staffers and personally ""attacking"" them. The IG report cited deteriorating morale under his ""divisive and ineffective"" leadership.::::::::Asked Thursday about the 2012 resignation and report, and how Gration's email practices compared with Clinton's, a State Department official gave a general response: ""In the summer of 2012, Ambassador Scott Gration offered his resignation as Ambassador to Kenya.

"31264"	"2015-03-06"	"Hillary Clinton emails: What's a 'homebrew' email server?"	"WASHINGTON (AP) -- No, it's not always a room filled with wires and glowing blue lights. It's probably not even the size of your furnace. The personal email server used by Hillary Rodham Clinton during her time as secretary of state was probably about the size of your office desktop computer and could have been tucked quietly in a corner somewhere.::::::::She's come a long way since 1997, when Clinton's staff bought the then-first lady a copy of the book ""E-Mail for Dummies.""::::::::Setting up your own email server is something only the geekiest of tech geeks do because of the serious hassles involved, including spending every waking hour fending off spam. Like brewing your own beer, it's typically done just for fun -- a way to challenge your smarts and fill the time. It also appeals to those who fear the government is sniffing around and could compel companies like Google or Yahoo to release customer data.::::::::""It's not trivial to do it, but if you understand how all this works, you can certainly do it yourself,"" said Carole Fennelly, a New York City-area information security consultant who once operated her own mail server and has set them up for clients.::::::::Setting up your own email server might only cost a few hundred dollars. A common and inexpensive solution might be to take an old computer running Windows; replace the guts of the machine with a free Linux operating system like Ubuntu; and install mail server software that lets you send and receive emails without the help of companies like Google or Yahoo.::::::::Before you get any ideas, Fennelly and other tech experts say there are so many headaches involved with ""homebrew"" email servers that it's almost never worth it. The cable companies that provide most people their Internet connections don't like them and will often block them because homebrew email servers tend to spew out lots of spam. So you'd have to buy a business-class connection or pay a hosting service. Even then, servers can crash and power outages occur, requiring backup generators and constant maintenance.::::::::""It's a huge, huge headache,"" said Christopher Soghoian of the American Civil Liberties Union.::::::::As the ACLU's principal technologist and a vocal opponent of government surveillance, Soghoian is exactly the type you'd expect to operate his own email server. But he says he's not comfortable with his technical ability to keep sophisticated hackers out and wonders what risks Clinton was taking. You could probably work around the clock to fend off spam and teenage hackers, he says. But what about the Chinese military?::::::::""What may be a fun activity for a 20-year-old tech whiz is probably a bad idea for the secretary of state,"" Soghoian said.::::::::So what's the point? In one word, control.::::::::Think of computer servers a bit like post offices. Every time you send an email, that message is stored on a server physically located at a facility owned by Yahoo or Google, for example. That server connects with other networks on the Internet and sends a copy to the intended recipient. At work, your employer probably runs its own email server, storing and sending copies from a computer system maintained by tech support staff.::::::::Either way, every time you write something online, a third party -- Yahoo or Google or your employer -- has a copy.::::::::This is what makes what Clinton did both sneaky and, some might say, genius: Instead of setting up an email account with the government -- for example, hillary.clinton(at)state.gov -- she operated a computer email server on an Internet connection that has been traced back to her family's hometown in New York. (The email, hdr22(at)clintonemail.com, appears to be a nod to her middle name, Diane.)::::::::No Yahoo employee with ambitions to become the next Edward Snowden could ever quietly search its server and leak her emails to the public. Google couldn't be compelled by congressional investigators to hand them over. If reporters were to ask the government for email records during Clinton's time as secretary of state, none would be found.::::::::In other words, if you want a complete record of Clinton's electronic correspondence while she was helping to decide matters of war and peace, you'd have to knock on her door and ask politely. Or take her to court.::::::::For Clinton, who is eyeing a presidential bid and is the wife of a former president, the hassle and expense of hiring consultants to manage the server might be worth it.::::::::For the average Joe, however, not so much.::::::::""When I saw that she had her own (server), I was like, 'Wow, that's a lot of hassle to go through,'"" said Fennelly.::::::::Follow Anne Flaherty at http://twitter.com/AnneKFlaherty and Nancy Benac at http://twitter.com/nbenac"
"31274"	"2015-03-06"	"Clinton Email Flap Could Signal Political Trouble Ahead"	"Why did Hillary Clinton opt to use a private email account for official business during her tenure as secretary of state?  And could this revelation really hurt her hopes of becoming the first woman president?::::::::Those are just two of the key questions at the heart of a controversy over her use of a private email account during her time at the State Department. :::::::::::::::: Republicans are trying to fan the controversy just as Democrats were looking ahead to what they expect will be the launch of Clinton’s presidential campaign later this year.::::::::The controversy was set off when the State Department confirmed that Clinton used a private email account for government business during her tenure as secretary of state instead of a government email address.  State Department officials said using a private email account was not prohibited and that Clinton never shared classified information over the account.  But critics want to know if it was a way for her to hide her communications.::::::::On her Twitter account, Clinton said she wanted “the public to see my email” and that she asked the State Department to release them.  State Department officials say the process of reviewing thousands of emails has begun but will take months.::::::::The revelation that Clinton used a private account sparked criticism from Republicans in Congress, including members of a special House of Representatives committee set up to investigate the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.  U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the attack, and Republicans have said Clinton should have done more as secretary of state to protect them.::::::::The committee chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, said he is eager to have access to the emails.::::::::“Only she has a complete record and the committee is going to have to go to her and her attorneys and her email providers to ensure we have access to everything the American people are entitled to know,” he said.::::::::The email flap unfolded just as Democrats began to eagerly anticipate Clinton announcing her candidacy for president sometime in the next few months.  Clinton seemed to hint at it again this week during a speech to Emily’s List, a political group that supports women candidates.::::::::“Don’t you want to see more women running for Congress?” Clinton asked.  “And I suppose it is only fair to say, don’t you someday want to see a woman president of the United States of America?”  The rest was drowned out by cheering.::::::::Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have come under fire in the past for seeming to hold back information, said political analyst Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia.::::::::“We know that they have a penchant for secrecy and that transparency often is alien to them,” he said. “Frequently they believe there are two sets of rules, one for them and one for everybody else.”::::::::But Sabato quickly added that it’s too soon to know what impact the controversy will have on Clinton as she prepares for what many expect will be a run for president in 2016.::::::::“The only significant political reaction to this will be if there is something explosive in the emails once they are presumably released,” he said. “If there is nothing explosive in there, this will fade away just like so many other issues that seem important at the moment.”::::::::But other experts aren’t so sure and warn the email controversy could signal political trouble ahead for Clinton.  Veteran political analyst Tom DeFrank of National Journal, who has covered both Bill and Hillary Clinton for years, spoke on VOA’s “Issues in the News” program.::::::::“To say they have a penchant for secrecy is an understatement,” he said. “They are obsessed with secrecy and this feeds into the narrative of the Clintons always straddling a fault line between crisis and disaster.  I mean this is not smart.”::::::::Despite the flap, most analysts still see Clinton as a heavy favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination should she run, including John Fortier of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.::::::::“I think she is the strongest figure,” Frotier said. “She has a lot going for her, as she did in 2008 I might add, and that did not work out for her.  What I think is certain is that she will have a challenge from her left.”::::::::And it may be Democrats on the left who are getting political heartburn over the email flap.  Recent polls show that Clinton remains by far the favorite for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.  But this latest controversy has begun to worry some Democratic activists who may be more open to seeking an alternative to Clinton.::::::::Among those Democrats who have indicated an interest in running next year are Vice President Joe Biden, former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders.  For now they are saying little about the email controversy."

""It didn't make sense to me that the State Department would ban my 'Gmail.com' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall,"" he told CNN.::::::::Spokespeople at the State Department repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the State Department Inspector General report about the U.S. embassy being run by Gration there were ""several concerns with management and leadership"" discussed, not just about his use of private email.::::::::The Inspector General report charged that Gration ""lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission"" and ""damaged the cohesion of Embassy Nairobi's country team.""::::::::Gration said he makes ""no apology for 'rocking the boat' in the State Department to improve physical security, to enhance cyber policy, and to conduct several other initiatives that the State Department Inspector General misrepresented to build the case that Secretary Clinton's Chief of Staff used to terminate my tenure as the U.S. ambassador in 2012.""::::::::The State Department's continued referencing of the other allegations against Gration came amidst fruitless attempts by CNN to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for Secretary Clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 Inspector General's report against Gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of ""commercial email for official government business"" which was considered to be ""flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy.""::::::::As CNN reported Thursday, the report stated clearly that It ""is the Department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,"" the report stated. ""The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information. The use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions. Conducting official business on non- Department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies.""::::::::Asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then-boss doing essentially the same thing, Gration told CNN ""I'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy. I learned long ago to do your best, do what was right, and to have a thick skin. I still wake up each day without regrets because I still have my integrity. That said, illegal, immoral, or unethical activities should be investigated properly, not just for political gain, but because we demand this of our public leaders.

"31301"	"2015-03-06"	"'How secure could it have been?' IT crowd questions if Hillary email could have ..."	"Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, by using her own email address and server for official business, was not only skirting government guidelines but taking serious cybersecurity risks as well, IT professionals tell FoxNews.com.::::::::While secretary, as the Associated Press first reported, Clinton was using her own private clintonemail.com domain, as well as doing government work on personal email.::::::::IT consultant Bruce Webster, who has been digging into the mystery of the private Clinton emails, says that while government servers are certainly vulnerable, they still have highly maintained controls and 24-7 monitoring for potential breaches.::::::::He said Clinton’s emails would have been less protected than if they went through the State Department networks.::::::::“The most secure way would have been to actually use the State.gov servers,” he told FoxNews.com. “[The government] takes security very seriously. They have whole platoons of people dedicated to ensuring their servers aren’t hacked.::::::::“If she has a private server running somewhere and she was doing everything on it, the question is, how secure could it have been?”::::::::He said it’s unclear whether Clinton ran a personal server in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home, as suggested Thursday by the Associated Press, or she maintained a dedicated one through a hosting service elsewhere. Webster said while Clinton may have had her own server, it could have been hosted externally. He found at least two Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with the clintonemail.com domain were also linked to two hosting services, Planet and Confluence Networks, “for the entire duration of the domain’s existence.”::::::::But even with an outside hosting service, he said, “you’re really opening the doors for a security breach,” depending on where the servers were, who had access to them, and whether the services were reputable.::::::::The level of security would depend on several factors.::::::::James Turner, a software engineer and freelance technology journalist, told FoxNews.com that using your own dedicated server for email – unlike a Gmail or Microsoft account – gives one “absolute control of it, and it’s not likely to be the target of someone looking for a large score.::::::::“If you’re an island unto yourself, you’d have to be specifically targeted. If it wasn’t well known, then it was probably safe.”::::::::But the secretary of state isn’t an ordinary email user. If someone had found out about the private domain, her server could be especially open to breaches unless she had the industrial-strength security operations to protect it.::::::::“A company like Google has an entire team of security folks doing nothing but locking doors,” Turner said.::::::::He said: “So the basic question is, did outsiders know about [Clinton’s] email server?”::::::::Clinton’s email domain reportedly surfaced in the case of one major hack – when Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal was breached by Romanian hacker Guccifer. Blumenthal reportedly was communicating with a “clintonemail.com” domain.::::::::Fox News has also learned from a prominent hacker that Clinton appears to have established multiple email addresses for her private use, and possibly the use of her aides, under that domain.:::::::::::::::: According to reports, Clinton employed an email security service on the backend, MX Logic, which scrubs emails before they are received for bugs and spam. It is not clear whether the government had access to her server at any time to ensure it maintained any formal security standards.::::::::According to an Al Jazeera America report, State Department technology experts were concerned about Clinton's use of a separate system, but their fears ""fell on deaf ears."":::::::::::::::: Aside from cybersecurity, the other major concern surrounding Clinton’s email practices is that they were not all automatically saved or considered part of records requests. That is why the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks subpoenaed her emails earlier this week.::::::::Clinton earlier turned over 55,000 emails to the department, when she was asked for them.

There were significant break-ins in 2006 (and 2014) -- and in 2010, U.S. soldier Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning swiped 250,000 diplomatic cables from the servers and gave them to WikiLeaks.::::::::“Ironically, Clinton’s server could have been more secure,” Turner said.::::::::But Matt Curtin, a cybersecurity consultant and president of Interhack, said whether the government is vulnerable is “irrelevant.” When someone with access to sensitive government information goes rogue with their email, he said, then the whole system is rendered “blind” and open to attack.::::::::“She doesn’t have the authority as secretary of state to go around the [security] controls,” he charged. “There are procedures and rules that govern the way this is managed.

"31314"	"2015-03-06"	"State Department Warned Against Private E-Mail Such as Clinton's"	"(Bloomberg) -- The Obama administration distanced itself Friday from Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail address, as new evidence emerged that the State Department had advised employees against the practice during her time as secretary.::::::::“The president has a very firm policy that e-mails should be kept on government systems,” Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser of President Barack Obama, said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker. “We believe in transparency and we believe public records, that they need to be captured.”::::::::The State Department sought to discourage employees from using private e-mail for government business at least three times during her tenure. In a cable to embassies in 2011 and two sections of its manual for employees that was updated 2005 and 2011, the department told employees to limit their use of private e-mail accounts. A watchdog report from August 2012 criticized the ambassador to Kenya for using a non-government e-mail account.::::::::Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 until February 2013 and is preparing to begin a presidential campaign, used a private e-mail account that was routed through a server at her suburban New York home. She says she turned over 55,000 pages of documents from the trove to the State Department in response to a request the agency sent to all former secretaries of state.::::::::Clinton asked the department to release those messages on Wednesday, and a spokesman has defended her practice.::::::::“Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government e-mail, as long as appropriate records were preserved,” Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said this week.::::::::A State Department spokeswoman Friday said the various policy documents and cable were meant as advice, and weren’t binding legal requirements.::::::::“This cable is totally about guidance and best practices,” spokeswoman Marie Harf said.::::::::In an update to the Foreign Affairs Manual, dated Nov. 14, 2011, the department outlined procedures for archiving e-mails that should be part of permanent records. The policy says users must preserve on government servers e-mails “where required by legal mandates (e.g., e-mails relevant to actual or anticipated litigation or in response to pending requests from Congress or under the Freedom of Information Act.)”::::::::Both congressional investigators and the conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch had sought Clinton’s e-mails regarding the attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.::::::::Government mandates require Clinton to preserve her records for posterity, and that should have been done earlier, said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle, former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA.::::::::“By failing to comply with a reasonable reading of NARA requirements to timely transfer records to the agency, they have created an issue as to how exactly they went about deciding what is or is not a record,” Baron said. “Clinton and her aides have now effectively decided what are and are not government records.”::::::::Separately, a policy detailing the handling of sensitive but unclassified materials says, “It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS, which has the proper level of security control.” AIS stands for Automated Information System.::::::::And the issue of government versus private e-mails was raised more than two years ago by the State Department inspector general. A watchdog report from August 2012, when Clinton was secretary, criticized the ambassador in Nairobi, Kenya, for using a non-government e-mail account.::::::::“It is the department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,” the report said. “The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of e-mail accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information.”::::::::Separately, a 2011 cable to all missions and embassies, which was signed by Clinton, warned employees about the risks of personal e-mail addresses in light of the hacking of Google’s Gmail accounts.::::::::“Avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts,” according to the cable, previously disclosed by Fox News.::::::::Some members of Obama’s White House staff, however, have routinely communicated with reporters and others using text messages and private e-mail accounts that aren’t part of the public record.::::::::White House press secretary Josh Earnest said some Obama staffers were aware that Clinton wasn’t using a government-issued e-mail address.::::::::“There were senior White House officials who were e-mailing with Secretary Clinton when she was in office,” Earnest told reporters traveling with the president to South Carolina on Friday.::::::::Earnest said that while White House officials may have “noted that she was not using a .gov e-mail address,” they had a reasonable assumption to think she was complying with the federal records act.::::::::He said he had no idea when the president learned about Clinton’s private e-mail server at her house and indicated that a matter involving an individual official’s e-mail wouldn’t be something brought to his attention. “The president obviously has a lot of things on his plate.”::::::::The White House has acknowledged some officials knew that House Republicans had knowledge of Clinton’s private e-mail account in August while working with the State Department to respond to document requests from the House select committee investigating the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.::::::::To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Drajem in Washington at mdrajem@bloomberg.net::::::::To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net Steve Geimann"

(Susan Walsh, File/Associated Press)::::::::WASHINGTON — Once again, Hillary Rodham Clinton did it her way, and it could cost her.::::::::Clinton’s decision to eschew government email and use her own private server as secretary of state is raising questions about secrecy, security and the law — including whether she might have deleted important messages tapped into her ever-present BlackBerry instead of preserving them for public scrutiny and history.::::::::At the least, the controversy is a bump on her unprecedented path from first lady to presumed presidential contender.::::::::What we know so far:::::::::She did all her official work as the nation’s top diplomat using a personal email account. Federal officials are generally expected to use their agencies’ email systems — the kind of addresses that have “.gov” at the end.::::::::Clinton didn’t use a commercial email server, like Google operates for Gmail, either. She had her own email server, traced to her hometown in Chappaqua, New York. The address: hdr22@clintonemail.com.::::::::Prior secretaries of state also used nongovernment email for work at times, or avoided using email much at all. Indeed, the State Department says the current secretary, John Kerry, is the first to have an official “@state.gov” address like other employees use routinely.::::::::The volume of the Clinton documents — she’s turned over 55,000 pages — makes her use of personal email more striking.::::::::IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH WHAT SHE DID?::::::::It raises two opposing sets of questions:::::::::A private account could have allowed her to withhold or destroy messages that she’s legally required to turn over for congressional investigations or lawsuits or to make available to the public, the press and historians under open-records law.::::::::A private email server may have left her sensitive government communications more vulnerable to people who shouldn’t see them, such as hackers and spies, because it lacked the heavy security of government accounts.::::::::Clinton says she’s turned over all relevant emails to the State Department. The House committee investigating the deadly attack on a diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, has issued subpoenas seeking messages that might not have been divulged.::::::::Clinton hasn’t released any information about her email server and its security features. Private email servers are generally not as reliable or secure as those used by the government or in commercial data centers.::::::::Clinton aides and the State Department both say she never received or transmitted classified information on her private account.::::::::That’s to be determined. Her aides say no.::::::::Her use of private email appears to conflict with the spirit of Barack Obama’s pledge to make his presidency the most open ever. She stands out even in an administration that has been criticized as failing to live up to that promise.::::::::However, Obama didn’t sign a law requiring the archiving of officials’ emails, including those on private accounts, until last November. Clinton left the State Department two years ago.::::::::Even back when she was in office, according to the White House, it was administration policy for officials to conduct their work on government email accounts. If their work strayed into personal emails, officials were responsible for making sure those messages were preserved for history.::::::::White House spokesman Josh Earnest says the vast majority of administration staffers work on government accounts, which should assure their emails are preserved automatically.::::::::Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill says much of her messaging was email back and forth with her State Department advisers on their government email, so the correspondence was retained on their end. Still, her emails to or from people outside the U.S. government — foreign officials, for example — would not be captured in that way.::::::::After the new law was signed last year, the State Department asked Clinton and other former secretaries of state for email records that should be preserved. That’s when Clinton turned over the 55,000 pages.::::::::Earnest said that if Clinton did in fact collect all of her personal email that was related to her official government work and turn it over, “that would be consistent with the Federal Records Act. And that’s the president’s expectation.”::::::::Yet only Clinton and her aides decided what to turn over.::::::::That leaves congressional investigators and others to wonder if she might be holding back things the public has a right to see about Benghazi or other topics.::::::::Clinton’s own office instructed State Department employees to avoid doing work by personal email.::::::::A June 2011 cable to employees warned that “online adversaries” were targeting personal accounts of department employees.::::::::The department now says those instructions concerned emails containing sensitive but unclassified information, such as personal information about employees or members of the public, business secrets or asylum applications.::::::::The issue came up again in a 2012 inspector general’s report.::::::::The report advised that reliance on “unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing and spoofing of email accounts,” as well as the loss of public records. The report criticized Scott Gration, then ambassador to Kenya, for using an outside email system, among several other problems under his leadership. He resigned.::::::::The State Department will review the mountain of Clinton emails for possible public release and for any security breaches. The process could take months, pushing the matter deeper into the 2016 presidential campaign. In a tweet this week, Clinton said she wanted the department to make her emails public as soon as possible.::::::::Congressional Republicans will keep pressing for emails that might shed light on Benghazi or other controversies, with Clinton’s potential presidential rivals surely paying rapt attention.::::::::The State Department is already under pressure to produce information under the nation’s open records law. It’s juggling nearly 11,000 pending requests for various emails, including more than 75 requests for Clinton material filed from 2009 to 2013 by media organizations and others. Associated Press requests for Clinton emails and other documents have been delayed for more than a year; in one instance, four years.::::::::WILL THIS BE A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ISSUE?::::::::It seems likely to linger into 2016. The story fits with critics’ longstanding portrayal of Clinton as secretive and operating above the rules.::::::::For example, it recalls the mystery of the missing Rose Law Firm records during the presidency of her husband, Bill Clinton.::::::::The billing records for some of her work as a lawyer in Arkansas were subpoenaed in the investigation of the Clintons’ Whitewater land deal. The papers were missing for nearly two years before the Clintons said they had unexpectedly turned up in a storage area in the residential portion of the White House.::::::::Clinton was called to testify about the billing records before a federal grand jury — an inauspicious first for a first lady.::::::::Her name also was sometimes caught up in the ethics and legal controversies during the Clinton presidency that culminated in Bill Clinton’s impeachment on perjury and obstruction of justice charges in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.::::::::Recently, she has also faced questions about her family’s charitable foundation taking money from foreign governments while she was running the State Department.::::::::Jeb Bush, expected to seek the presidency on the Republican side, also used a personal email account — jeb@jeb.org — on a personal server, while he was Florida governor.::::::::Florida’s public records law is among the nation’s strongest. Bush was required to turn over emails related to his work as governor from 1999 to 2007 to the state archives, making them public.::::::::In a show of transparency, Bush obtained those emails from the archivist and posted more than 275,000 online at jebemails.com last month.::::::::In an example of how tricky public records issues can be, the vast email cache made public included some Floridians’ birthdays and Social Security numbers. A spokeswoman said people’s private information was removed from the website after it was discovered.::::::::But like Clinton, Bush did not turn over what he determined to be personal messages on his account.::::::::Democrats are raising the same questions about Bush that are being asked of Clinton: How can the public be sure that he turned over all relevant emails from his time in office?::::::::Though Bush has taken a couple of swipes at Clinton over her emails, criticism from Republican presidential hopefuls has been muted so far, perhaps because it is a sensitive issue for several of them.::::::::Email from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, has become part of criminal investigations.::::::::ONE LAST QUESTION: WHO HAS THEIR OWN EMAIL SERVER, ANYWAY?::::::::Anybody could, but it’s a pretty geeky pursuit.::::::::A private server doesn’t take a lot of room or a special power source. It could be the size of your desktop computer and sit unobtrusively in your home.::::::::Some people set them up as a techy hobby. Others acquire them for privacy, because they don’t trust corporate email providers to keep their messages out of the hands of hackers or government snoops.::::::::Clinton might also have been worried about leaks.

The heat was turned up after Politico reported that top White House officials knew back in August that Clinton was conducting official business on personal email.::::::::White House spokesman Josh Earnest, when asked about what the White House knew, said senior officials were emailing Clinton while she was secretary of state and a few noticed she wasn't using a .gov email address. However, he did not say when they noticed it and whether red flags were raised.::::::::He also said he had no idea when President Obama first found out and claimed he wouldn't be surprised if Obama only learned about it from ""newspapers.""::::::::Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg News Friday morning, Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said she never received email from Clinton’s private address, and didn’t know whether anyone at the White House, including the president, had either.::::::::“That I do not know,” she said when pressed by the reporters.::::::::As for herself, “I did not receive email from Secretary Clinton,” she said, adding that “the president has a very firm policy that emails should be kept on government systems, he believes in transparency and I know that the State Department is working with the National Archives to make sure that Secretary Hillary Clinton’s emails are captured.”::::::::According to Politico, the White House, State Department and Clinton’s personal office knew in August that the former secretary of state had used a private email to conduct official business. The State Department became aware while the agency was preparing a batch of 15,000 emails requested by House Republicans in the Benghazi investigation.::::::::“State Department officials noticed that some of the 15,000 pages of documents included a personal email address for Clinton, and State and White House officials conferred on how to handle the revelation,” Politico wrote. “But those involved deferred to Clinton’s aides, and they decided not to respond.""::::::::While it is not clear who in the White House did the conferring, Jamal Ware, spokesman for the Republican-led Select Committee on Benghazi, confirmed that committee staff first noticed Clinton was included on messages at the address hdr22@clintonemail.com when going through the State Department documents in “late summer,” and then on more documents supplied by the agency in February.::::::::However, Ware told The Associated Press on Thursday that it wasn’t until Feb. 28, just days before the scandal broke, that the State Department acknowledged Clinton only used personal email while in office. After that, the committee, chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., announced it has subpoenaed all of Clinton’s emails relating to Benghazi – including any communications from her personal email and server, as well as texts, attachments and pictures.::::::::The Associated Press earlier this week quoted an anonymous source saying the White House counsel's office was also not aware of Clinton's exclusive use of personal email during her tenure, and only found out as part of the congressional investigation.::::::::Observers say the White House is in the difficult position of defending the former Cabinet secretary and likely Democratic 2016 presidential candidate, while being careful not to get caught up in the mess itself. According to the AP, top White House aides have been “in contact” Clinton's people “to clarify specific facts that the White House is likely to be asked about” and have advised them about what the White House had planned to say.::::::::""It's almost impossible for the White House to give firm answers because there's just too much you don't know,"" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's former press secretary. ""It's an extraordinarily delicate dance they have to do to not throw someone overboard, but not get anyone in the White House in deeper trouble.”::::::::The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"31365"	"2015-03-06"	"Bush finds Hillary Clinton's e-mail practice 'baffling'"	"Presumptive GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Friday that he found it “baffling” that Hillary Rodham Clinton used a private e-mail server while secretary of state, a practice that has prompted sharp criticism of Clinton in recent days.::::::::Bush — who could end up facing Clinton in a run for the White House next year — also said he would stop using his private e-mail address if elected president.::::::::“For security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is, and it’s a dangerous world, and security would mean that you couldn’t have a private server,” Bush said in an interview with Radio Iowa. “It’s a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn’t come up in Secretary Clinton’s thought process.”::::::::Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department from her four-year tenure as secretary of state. She never had a State Department e-mail account, using her own “clintonemail.com” address through a private server in her New York home.::::::::The arrangement — revealed in news reports this week — has led to a storm of criticism from government-transparency advocates and ­Republican lawmakers, who accuse her of attempting to evade federal public records law. It has also created a political complication for Clinton — the presumptive Democratic front-runner for president — and some Democrats have expressed concern about its impact on the presidential race.::::::::Clinton, after remaining silent as questions mounted, said in a tweet late Wednesday that “I want the public to see my email” and has asked the State Department to release them.::::::::State Department officials have said that Clinton and her private staff, not the agency, decided which of her e-mail correspondence from her four years in office to turn over. The department has launched a review to determine which of the e-mails can be made public.::::::::In the wake of the Clinton revelations, Bush and his campaign-in-waiting have touted his decision to publish hundreds of thousands of e-mails he sent and received while serving as governor and using a personal e-mail address, jeb@jeb.org.::::::::But Bush’s e-mail cache only includes self-selected messages that he was required to release in compliance with Florida public records laws. The Web site housing his e-mails doesn’t include any correspondence related to his political activities or between him and his family or friends.::::::::Regardless, Bush aides argue that he has gone beyond what Clinton and his potential GOP rivals for president have done or are willing to do on transparency.::::::::Bush spoke Friday just before traveling to Iowa for his first trip to the state ahead of his presumed presidential campaign. He planned to appear Friday night at a GOP fundraiser and make three campaign-style stops across the state Saturday. During the radio interview, he indicated that he’s seriously preparing a presidential run.::::::::“The possibility of running is daunting and running would be even more so,” he said. “I think the lesson learned that I took away from Iowa in my forays in there for my dad and my brother is that you’ve got to be all in. You’ve got to really take the time to meet people and campaign there actively one-on-one and on a personal level.”"
"31395"	"2015-03-06"	"White House defers questions on Hillary Clinton's private email use"	"The White House gently distanced itself Friday from the controversy swirling around former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and State Department officials over Clinton's use of a personal email account during her four years in office.::::::::Amid growing criticism of the practice from Republicans and open-records advocates, White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett said the Obama administration had set a policy of requiring federal officials to use only agency-run email addresses, and made departmental officials responsible for seeing that it was followed.::::::::“The president has a very firm policy that email should be kept on government systems,” Jarrett, one of Obama's inner circle, said on the Bloomberg TV show “Market Makers.” “We established the policy here, but then we leave it up to every single agency to determine how to adhere to that policy.”::::::::Separately, a government official said the White House general counsel's office, which had a role in overseeing record-keeping rules, knew nothing of Clinton's use of the personal email account during her term. The legal office learned of the practice late last year, said the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the subject.::::::::Critics say Clinton's use of a special “homebrew” server linked to her Chappaqua, N.Y., residence gave her special control over her communications, and left uncertain whether she had complied fully with federal rules requiring such records to be archived and retrievable.::::::::The State Department has begun reviewing 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails to see whether they comply with disclosure rules and can be released to the public. The process will take months to complete, officials say, probably keeping the controversy alive until long after the expected formal announcement of Clinton's presidential candidacy next month.::::::::The White House has been seeking to hand off questions about the controversy to Clinton and State Department officials.::::::::But Clinton's team, which asserts nothing improper took place, has said little. And State Department officials have been unable so far to explain whether anyone at the department reviewed Clinton's plans in advance, or checked to see that her system met security standards for internal communications.::::::::At a daily State Department briefing on Friday, spokeswoman Marie Harf was asked whether the department's lawyers or other officials were aware of Clinton's plans and gave permission for them.::::::::“I don't have details to answer that question for you,” she said.::::::::She said the department's look at the emails wasn't aimed at determining whether they broke any rules, but only whether :::::::: the material should be released.::::::::Harf wouldn't comment on what officials would do if any violations were found, saying, “I'm not going to prejudge the outcome of the review.”::::::::Two congressional panels, the House Select Committee on Benghazi and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, are investigating the emails, and other committees are considering whether to take part. The Benghazi panel, which has been examining Clinton's role in the Sept. 11, 2012, fatal attack on U.S. facilities in the Libyan city, subpoenaed State Department documents on Wednesday.::::::::Clinton's possible rivals are also paying attention.::::::::Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in an interview with Radio Iowa on Friday, suggested that Clinton's use of a private server was a security risk.::::::::“For security purposes, you need to be behind a firewall that recognizes the world for what it is, and it's been a dangerous world and security would mean that you couldn't have a private server,” he said. “It's a little baffling, to be honest with you, that didn't come up in Secretary Clinton's thought process.”::::::::Democratic members of the Benghazi committee on Friday sent a letter to its chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), complaining that the matter was being used by Republicans to attack Clinton.::::::::“We urge you to withdraw the ill-considered subpoena — whose issuance to a cooperating witness served only to highlight the increasingly partisan nature of the committee's focus — and to immediately publish the secretary's emails in their entirety, as she has requested,” they wrote."

The heat was turned up after Politico reported that top White House officials knew back in August that Clinton was conducting official business on personal email.::::::::White House spokesman Josh Earnest, when asked about what the White House knew, said senior officials were emailing Clinton while she was secretary of state and a few noticed she wasn't using a .gov email address. However, he did not say when they noticed it and whether red flags were raised.::::::::He also said he had no idea when President Obama first found out and claimed he wouldn't be surprised if Obama only learned about it from ""newspapers.""::::::::Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg News Friday morning, Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said she never received email from Clinton’s private address, and didn’t know whether anyone at the White House, including the president, had either.::::::::“That I do not know,” she said when pressed by the reporters.::::::::As for herself, “I did not receive email from Secretary Clinton,” she said, adding that “the president has a very firm policy that emails should be kept on government systems, he believes in transparency and I know that the State Department is working with the National Archives to make sure that Secretary Hillary Clinton’s emails are captured.”::::::::According to Politico, the White House, State Department and Clinton’s personal office knew in August that the former secretary of state had used a private email to conduct official business. The State Department became aware while the agency was preparing a batch of 15,000 emails requested by House Republicans in the Benghazi investigation.::::::::“State Department officials noticed that some of the 15,000 pages of documents included a personal email address for Clinton, and State and White House officials conferred on how to handle the revelation,” Politico wrote. “But those involved deferred to Clinton’s aides, and they decided not to respond.""::::::::While it is not clear who in the White House did the conferring, Jamal Ware, spokesman for the Republican-led Select Committee on Benghazi, confirmed that committee staff first noticed Clinton was included on messages at the address hdr22@clintonemail.com when going through the State Department documents in “late summer,” and then on more documents supplied by the agency in February.::::::::However, Ware told The Associated Press on Thursday that it wasn’t until Feb. 28, just days before the scandal broke, that the State Department acknowledged Clinton only used personal email while in office. After that, the committee, chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., announced it has subpoenaed all of Clinton’s emails relating to Benghazi – including any communications from her personal email and server, as well as texts, attachments and pictures.::::::::The Associated Press earlier this week quoted an anonymous source saying the White House counsel's office was also not aware of Clinton's exclusive use of personal email during her tenure, and only found out as part of the congressional investigation.::::::::Observers say the White House is in the difficult position of defending the former Cabinet secretary and likely Democratic 2016 presidential candidate, while being careful not to get caught up in the mess itself. According to the AP, top White House aides have been “in contact” Clinton's people “to clarify specific facts that the White House is likely to be asked about” and have advised them about what the White House had planned to say.::::::::""It's almost impossible for the White House to give firm answers because there's just too much you don't know,"" said Ari Fleischer, President George W.

A diplomatic source told Fox News that was code inside the department for the so-called Cheryl Mills task force, whose job was damage control.::::::::The effort to stop Nuland from answering reporter questions also may have contributed to confusion over the nature of the attack.

Federal officials are generally expected to use their agencies’ email systems — the kind of addresses that have “.gov” at the end.::::::::Clinton didn’t use a commercial email server, like Google operates for Gmail, either. She had her own email server, traced to her hometown in Chappaqua, New York. The address: hdr22@clintonemail.com.::::::::Prior secretaries of state also used nongovernment email for work at times, or avoided using email much at all. Indeed, the State Department says the current secretary, John Kerry, is the first to have an official “@state.gov” address like other employees use routinely.::::::::The volume of the Clinton documents — she’s turned over 55,000 pages — makes her use of personal email more striking.::::::::IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH WHAT SHE DID?::::::::It raises two opposing sets of questions:::::::::A private account could have allowed her to withhold or destroy messages that she’s legally required to turn over for congressional investigations or lawsuits or to make available to the public, the press and historians under open-records law.::::::::A private email server may have left her sensitive government communications more vulnerable to people who shouldn’t see them, such as hackers and spies, because it lacked the heavy security of government accounts.::::::::Clinton says she’s turned over all relevant emails to the State Department. The House committee investigating the deadly attack on a diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, has issued subpoenas seeking messages that might not have been divulged.::::::::Clinton hasn’t released any information about her email server and its security features. Private email servers are generally not as reliable or secure as those used by the government or in commercial data centers.::::::::Clinton aides and the State Department both say she never received or transmitted classified information on her private account.::::::::That’s to be determined. Her aides say no.::::::::Her use of private email appears to conflict with the spirit of Barack Obama’s pledge to make his presidency the most open ever.

Still, her emails to or from people outside the U.S. government — foreign officials, for example — would not be captured in that way.::::::::After the new law was signed last year, the State Department asked Clinton and other former secretaries of state for email records that should be preserved. That’s when Clinton turned over the 55,000 pages.::::::::Earnest said that if Clinton did in fact collect all of her personal email that was related to her official government work and turn it over, “that would be consistent with the Federal Records Act. And that’s the president’s expectation.”::::::::Yet only Clinton and her aides decided what to turn over.::::::::That leaves congressional investigators and others to wonder if she might be holding back things the public has a right to see about Benghazi or other topics.::::::::Clinton’s own office instructed State Department employees to avoid doing work by personal email.::::::::A June 2011 cable to employees warned that “online adversaries” were targeting personal accounts of department employees.::::::::The department now says those instructions concerned emails containing sensitive but unclassified information, such as personal information about employees or members of the public, business secrets or asylum applications.::::::::The issue came up again in a 2012 inspector general’s report.::::::::The report advised that reliance on “unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing and spoofing of email accounts,” as well as the loss of public records. The report criticized Scott Gration, then ambassador to Kenya, for using an outside email system, among several other problems under his leadership. He resigned.::::::::The State Department will review the mountain of Clinton emails for possible public release and for any security breaches. The process could take months, pushing the matter deeper into the 2016 presidential campaign. In a tweet this week, Clinton said she wanted the department to make her emails public as soon as possible.::::::::Congressional Republicans will keep pressing for emails that might shed light on Benghazi or other controversies, with Clinton’s potential presidential rivals surely paying rapt attention.::::::::The State Department is already under pressure to produce information under the nation’s open records law. It’s juggling nearly 11,000 pending requests for various emails, including more than 75 requests for Clinton material filed from 2009 to 2013 by media organizations and others. Associated Press requests for Clinton emails and other documents have been delayed for more than a year; in one instance, four years.::::::::WILL THIS BE A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ISSUE?::::::::It seems likely to linger into 2016.

"31495"	"2015-03-07"	"Hillary?s Secret Email Was a Cyberspy?s Dream Weapon"	"When a notorious online break-in artist got a hold of the Secretary of State’s now-infamous email address, he gave himself the power to use it to target the global elite.::::::::The private email address for Hillary Clinton, which became the talk of Washington this week and created her first major speed bump on her road to the White House, has actually been freely available on the Internet for a year, thanks to a colorful Romanian hacker known as Guccifer.::::::::On March 14, 2013, Guccifer—his real name is Marcel-Lehel Lazar—broke into the AOL account of Sidney Blumenthal, a journalist, former White House aide to Bill Clinton, and personal confidante of Hillary Clinton. Lazar crowed about his exploits to journalists, disclosing a set of memos Blumenthal had written to Clinton in 2012, as well as the personal email address and domain she’s now known to have used exclusively for her personal and official correspondence.::::::::Few journalists noticed that at the time, and it caused no ruckus in Washington. But the fact that Clinton’s private email was now public means she was not just putting her own information at risk, but potentially those in the circle of people who knew her private address.::::::::Her email account was the ultimate hacker’s lure. It’s a common technique to impersonate a trusted source via email, in order to persuade a recipient to download spyware hidden inside seemingly innocuous attachments. Indeed, Clinton’s own staff had been targeted with such highly targeted “spear phishing” emails as early as 2009, the year she took office. And according to U.S. authorities, Lazar, who’s now serving a seven-year prison sentence in Romania and is accused of hacking the accounts of other Washington notables like as Colin Powell, did commandeer other people’s email accounts. Then he used them to send messages exposing the private correspondence of his other victims.::::::::When her address was exposed, Clinton was running her private email account on equipment in her home in New York, which security experts say is an inherently weak setup that made her more vulnerable to backing.::::::::It’s not clear whether Lazar tried to hack Clinton’s domain or if he used his access to Blumenthal’s account to do so. But he was within digital striking distance of the secretary, inside the email of a Clinton ally who, as one longtime Blumenthal friend told The Daily Beast, is “a blooded member of Hillaryland, perhaps the personification of that corps who are closest to her inner circle.”::::::::Blumenthal sent Clinton a range of missives covering topics as U.S.-Egyptian relations to how she was recovering from a concussion. Once he was inside Blumenthal’s account, Lazar could have easily “spear phished” this most senior member of President Obama’s cabinet.::::::::Blumenthal still maintains the once-hacked AOL account. Requests for comment sent there weren’t returned.::::::::Before Lazar exposed the email domain, it would have been known to people with whom Clinton was trading emails, as well as to a tight inner circle lucky enough to be given @clintonemail.com accounts. Those included Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, and aide Human Abedin, whom the former secretary treats like family. Maybe Clinton and her staff thought the relative anonymity of her email domain would have given her a measure of security. It’s hard to say, since they and State Department officials have consistently refused to answer journalists questions about what security measures Clinton took to protect her “homebrew” email system.::::::::But “assuming that the domain is ‘secret’ is a dangerous assumption,” Johannes Ullrich, a computer security expert with the SANS Institute, told The Daily Beast.::::::::“A not-well-published domain does not provide significant protection,” Ullrich said. “As seen in the Guccifer incident, it is easy to unmask such domains if just one of the individuals she is corresponding with is breached. At the same note, running a mail server securely is difficult.”::::::::Ullrich said that because email servers communicate with many different outside systems, “e-mail is probably the most dangerous attack vector” that a hacker could use. The fact that Lazar had exposed her private account a year ago suggests that Clinton could have taken steps at the time to better protect herself. Whether she did or not, her aides aren’t saying.::::::::“We have no indication the account was hacked or compromised,” a senior State Department official told the Daily Beast. But unless State inspected the system, officials have no way of knowing that. By the department’s own admission, officials didn’t contact Clinton about turning over emails on her account until October 2014, nearly two years after she’d left office, when the law on official records was being changed to cover emails sent on private accounts.::::::::Had security experts checked the system, they might not have liked what they saw. One security scan this week revealed that the domain uses “obsolete and insecure” protocols and gave it an overall F rating.::::::::The only Blumenthal emails Lazar is known to have disclosed, within days of hacking the account, were four memos from September 2012, marked “classified,” and containing what Blumenthal described as on-the-ground intelligence about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The disclosure tipped off Blumenthal to the breach, allowing him to change the password on his account and regain control.::::::::Perhaps fortunately for Clinton, Lazar was more interested in snooping than spying. That may explain why he may have passed on a golden opportunity to get inside Clinton’s email account, as well. He’s “just a smart guy who was very patient and persistent” and who “wanted to be famous” for showing that he could embarrass Washington power brokers and other celebrities, a Romanian prosecutor told the New York Times, which published a profile of Lazar last year. Among the purloined correspondence he disclosed were emails between Powell and a Romanian diplomat, which were so intimate that Powell had to publicly declare the woman was just a friend and nothing more.::::::::In an interview with the the Times, the imprisoned hacker rambled about “a potpourri of conspiracy theories” he tied to the so-called Illuminati, whom he described as the “very rich people, noble families, bankers and industrialists from the 19th and 20th century” that he said run the world, are responsible for the death of Princess Diana and the 9/11 attacks, and whose email the world deserves to see.::::::::He now seems hardly much of a threat, and was apprehended by Romanian authorities after bragging about his high-profile American victims secretly running the world. He’d also targeted Romanian officials, making him a wanted man in his own country.::::::::But plenty of people were trying to spy on Clinton and the people around her, and Lazar arguably made their job easier.::::::::Indeed, Clinton had been targeted by hackers and cyber spies practically from the moment she took office. In 2009, a senior member of Clinton’s staff received a spear phishing email that purported to come from a colleague in the office next door, according to former officials with knowledge of the matter. The email contained an attachment that the sender claimed was related to a recent meeting, but the recipient couldn’t recall that the meeting had ever occurred. When he inquired with his colleague, he was met with a blank stare.::::::::Had the Clinton staffer opened the attachment, it would have installed spyware on his computer and potentially allowed a hacker to spy on other people using the State Department network. Former officials said the spear phishing email likely came from China.::::::::That same year, in a separate hacking attempt, five State Department employees who were negotiating with Chinese officials on efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions received spear phishing emails claiming to come from a prominent Washington journalist, Bruce Stokes.::::::::Signs pointed to the email being legitimate: The U.S. climate change envoy, Todd Stern, was a friend of Stokes’, and the subject line of the email read “China and Climate Change,” which seemed like a reporter’s inquiry. Stokes is also married to Ambassador Wendy Sherman, a seasoned diplomat who went on to lead U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. The body of the message included comments related to the recipients’ jobs and their work at the time.::::::::The spear phishing incident was documented in a State Department cable, part of a massive cached disclosed by WikiLeaks. It’s unclear whether anyone opened an attachment in the email that contained a virus, which could siphon information off the infected computer. But whomever sent the message had studied Stokes, knew who his associates were, and understood what would prompt them to trust the email.::::::::It’s that kind of information that a reasonably sophisticated hacker could glean from someone in touch with the secretary of state. What was on her mind? What did she care about? What was likely to get her to open an attachment? Knowing the private domain Clinton used would have made any spear phishing email look more legitimate.::::::::“At the very least, she should have been worried about individuals impersonating the [clintonemail.com] domain,” Ullrich said. Setting up standard mail filtering mechanisms and proper security certificates “would be a first step, but that should have happened right from the start,” he said.::::::::Right from the start would have been in the days before her Senate confirmation in 2009, when the private email account was set up. If Clinton didn’t realize then that she was a security risk then, the Chinese hackers trying to break into her office should have tipped her off."

That includes Republicans who have criticized their potential Democratic rival.::::::::“Hillary Clinton’s potential evasion of laws is something she should answer questions about,” said Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who once used a private email system as executive of Milwaukee County.::::::::Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, both Republicans, also criticized Clinton, even though they each used private emails when they held the post as their state’s top executive.::::::::A “patchwork” of federal and state public information laws was written “for the era of paper records” that now “aren’t serving us well” in the digital age, said Charles Davis, journalism and communications dean at the University of Georgia and an expert on public information laws.::::::::“This is the bedeviling thing: It’s good-government law that rests on the honesty and transparency of public officials,” he said. “If a government official sets out on a mission to lie to the public or withhold from the public by using private email or some other means, there’s not much we can do about it.”"

But unfortunately, e-mails have brought down or troubled many people including police officers, government officials and even a possible presidential candidate recently. Here's just a touch of some problems created by e-mails.::::::::This week, Hillary Rodham Clinton asked the State Department to disclose e-mails from her tenure as Secretary of State, amid controversy over the use of a private account for government business. Clinton reportedly used a private e-mail server installed in her home and her own Internet domain — clintonemail.com — to conduct public business. When the State Department requested that she return those government records, she provided the department with 55,000 pages of e-mails, the department has said. But Republicans are demanding an independent investigation to review all her e-mails, not just the ones she ""handpicked for release.""::::::::Meanwhile, VICE News reported Saturday that it had obtained the first official release of an e-mail associated with Clinton's private email account. It was sent to Clinton on Christmas Eve 2010 by then-State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley under the subject line ""WikiLeaks Update."" ""Madame Secretary, first of all, Merry Christmas. I trust you, the President and Chelsea will have a special holiday,"" Crowley wrote, copying Clinton's aides and other top State Department officials. The rest of the e-mail was redacted, according to VICE News.::::::::David Petraeus reached a plea agreement this week with the Justice Department, after he gave Paula Broadwell, who was his mistress and biographer, secret information including names of covert officers and war strategy. The retired four-star general delivered the information through physical books containing classified and unclassified notes. But, Petraeus sent Broadwell an e-mail in which he agreed to provide the black books to his biographer. Meanwhile, the affair was discovered because an acquaintance of Petraeus, Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, complained about harassing e-mails that investigators traced back to Broadwell. An e-mail from an account named ""Kelley Patrol"" warned Gen. John Allen, commander of the military forces in Afghanistan, that contact with Kelley could ""harm his reputation.""::::::::Lois Lerner is the former Internal Revenue Service official at the center of a controversy over the targeting of political groups for extra scrutiny. Last year, the IRS told congressional committees investigating the affair that it lost many of Lerner's e-mails. Seven hard drive crashes, the lack of a centralized archive, a practice of erasing and reusing backup tapes every six months, not to mention an IRS policy of allowing employees to decide for themselves which e-mails constitute an official agency record, led the IRS to lose Lerner's e-mails.::::::::Hackers stole embarrassing e-mails from Sony Pictures, revealing among other things an exchange between Sony Pictures entertainment chief Amy Pascal and high-powered Hollywood producer Scott Rudin. Their exchanges included mocking movies featuring black actors and seemed to assume that President Obama, because he's black, would prefer movies featuring blacks. Pascal suggested Obama liked Django. Rudin suggested 12 Years a Slave. She came back with The Butler. ""Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,"" Rudin replied.::::::::Two Ferguson, Mo. police officers and a court clerk no longer work for the city after being disciplined for sending racist e-mails discovered by the Justice Department. Officers, Rick Henke and William Mudd resigned Thursday after they were suspended over the e-mails. Mary Twitty, a court clerk, was fired on Wednesday. Among the e-mails was a missive apparently sent soon after President Obama's 2008 election. It suggested that he would not remain long in the job because ""what black man holds a steady job for four years.'' Another May 2011 e-mail referred to an African-American woman receiving a ""Crime-stoppers'' reward for terminating a pregnancy."

Bush Jr.’s administration pulled that trick in 2007 during the U.S. Attorney’s dismissal scandal as well.::::::::Interesting, though, when that scandal erupted, Hillary said, “I think one of the hallmarks of our democracy is we have a devotion to the rule of law.”::::::::You mean like the rules in place when she was secretary of state?::::::::The rules, as ABC News pointed out, dictated that employees could only use private emails for business if they turned those emails over to government computers.::::::::Those same rules dictated that private emails were not permitted to include forbidden or sensitive information, “except under some very narrow exceptions.” Maybe all of Hillary’s emails fell into the narrow exceptions category.::::::::Clinton also presumably discussed Clinton Foundation monkey business in those emails. Not that anybody would ever figure those out, since the foundation’s financial disclosures make the Vatican’s look like an open Bible.::::::::As for Clinton being women’s great bright hope on this International Women’s Day?::::::::Hillary lore demands that we women adhere to the company line that she’s all about women. Right. Unless they’ve been involved with her husband, which could be a good 10% of the population right there.::::::::And Hillary mythology suggests she has been a tireless champion of equal pay for equal work. Unless she’s the one controlling the payroll.::::::::The Washington Free Beacon reported recently that when Hillary was senator from New York, women on her staff earned 72 cents for every buck a male made.::::::::And women’s median annual salary was $15,708.38 less than those of the males on her staff.::::::::A Clinton apologist explained it all conveniently away, saying that despite how the numbers appear, women held the highest positions on her staff.::::::::Meaning what? The mailroom guys earned more than her top female staffers?::::::::A separate but equally appalling disparity exists at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, where men make the top eight salaries; the top male makes $484,257 a year, while the top female pulls down less than half at $201,023.::::::::On this International Women’s Day, it’s time that women stop holding out Hillary — with her scandal-scarred marriage and résumé — as our feminist ideal.::::::::There are many qualified women who are being shut out from throwing their hats into the ring by the presumed nominee.

It’s not a bug, it is a function! It’s not a scandal, it is an chance!::::::::The most recent scandal du jour requires Hillary’s bizarre, nearly-impossible-to-believe, up-till-now-under no circumstances-revealed refusal to use a government e mail address as secretary of state.::::::::As an alternative, she utilised a wide variety of individual email addresses from a private Clinton server.::::::::Not that she’s the very first top rated-level official to screw about with emails. Bush Jr.’s administration pulled that trick in 2007 throughout the U.S. Attorney’s dismissal scandal as well.::::::::Fascinating, although, when that scandal erupted, Hillary stated, “I think one particular of the hallmarks of our democracy is we have a devotion to the rule of law.”::::::::You mean like the rules in place when she was secretary of state?::::::::The guidelines, as ABC News pointed out, dictated that employees could only use private emails for business enterprise if they turned these emails over to government computer systems.::::::::Those exact same guidelines dictated that private emails were not permitted to involve forbidden or sensitive details, “except under some pretty narrow exceptions.” Maybe all of Hillary’s emails fell into the narrow exceptions category.::::::::Clinton also presumably discussed Clinton Foundation monkey organization in these emails. Not that anybody would ever figure these out, since the foundation’s economic disclosures make the Vatican’s appear like an open Bible.::::::::As for Clinton becoming women’s excellent vibrant hope on this International Women’s Day?::::::::Hillary lore demands that we females adhere to the business line that she’s all about girls. Correct. Unless they’ve been involved with her husband, which could be a very good 10% of the population proper there.::::::::And Hillary mythology suggests she has been a tireless champion of equal pay for equal perform. Unless she’s the one particular controlling the payroll.::::::::The Washington Totally free Beacon reported not too long ago that when Hillary was senator from New York, females on her staff earned 72 cents for each and every buck a male created.::::::::And women’s median annual salary was $15,708.38 less than those of the males on her staff.::::::::A Clinton apologist explained it all conveniently away, saying that regardless of how the numbers seem, girls held the highest positions on her staff.::::::::Which means what? The mailroom guys earned more than her major female staffers?::::::::A separate but equally appalling disparity exists at the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, exactly where guys make the major eight salaries the prime male makes $484,257 a year, whilst the major female pulls down much less than half at $201,023.::::::::On this International Women’s Day, it is time that ladies quit holding out Hillary — with her scandal-scarred marriage and résumé — as our feminist ideal.::::::::There are many qualified women who are getting shut out from throwing their hats into the ring by the presumed nominee. These are girls who could clean House — each homes in reality — without the need of bringing along all that dirty, dirty laundry.::::::::It has been a year due to the fact Malaysia Flight 370 disappeared without a trace and, so far, devoid of an explanation.::::::::Despite CNN once speculating that it got sucked up by a black hole (a tiny black hole would suck up the universe), the flight numbers would, on the other hand, drive a numerologist insane.::::::::There has been a weird quantity of crashes involving the mixture of 3, seven and zero more than the decades.::::::::In 1954, Cameroon Airline Flight 3701, a Boeing 737, crashed on approach to Douala International Airport in Cameroon. In 1959, TAI Flight 307 crashed among France and the Ivory Coast. On March three, 1973, Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Flight 307 crashed near the runway of the Sheremetyevo International Airport.::::::::But weirdest, on March 7, 1950 — the very same date as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was preparing for takeoff — a Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 307 crashed as it approached the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.::::::::A mother in Wisconsin was in a Facebook chat minutes just before crashing her SUV into an oncoming truck, killing her 11-year-old daughter and her two 5-year-old nieces.::::::::The mother, Kari Milberg — who had taken Oxycodone and one more sedative — thought that the life of whomever she was texting was additional significant than the lives of those little ones.::::::::Maybe this will serve as a lesson to the rest of us, but almost certainly not.::::::::We know if you text and drive, you may perhaps not reside (or your youngsters will not at any rate), but what about texting when consuming, playing, caring for and spending what utilised to be good quality time with your kids?::::::::When you’re busy posting that fantastic version of your life with your little ones you want everybody to think is real, you are losing that moment with your little ones, parents and spouse in real life.::::::::Let’s put down the damn smartphones and smarten up.::::::::Greatest line of the Week: J.J.

However, what remains unclear is how many emails she did not give the federal government and the content of the messages.::::::::“This is a bogus notion -- what might be the case, compared to what is the case,” he said. “Nobody says it was illegal.”::::::::The GOP-led House said last week, after news broke about the private emails, that it will subpoena the documents.::::::::Davis vehemently defended Clinton and his association with the first family, acknowledging he was “proud” to defend the former first lady and President Bill Clinton through the Monica Lewinsky scandal and a campaign-finance investigation. He said the Clintons have provided “great public services” through their years in appointed and elected office, including Hillary Clinton’s turn as a U.S. senator for New York.::::::::He also defended Clinton's use of personal emails by saying it was “convenient” while she traveled around the world as the country’s top diplomat, but never clearly explained why."

That raises questions about Hillary Clinton’s controversial e-mail as secretary of state, and it may account for a drop in her poll rating on honesty.::::::::Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton wave at a university conference sponsored by their Clinton Global Initiative at the University of Miami, Saturday in Coral Gables, Fla.::::::::If those messages from hdr22@clintonemail.com – his secretary of state using a personal e-mail address and private server rather than the more secure government system – were an odd way of communicating sensitive diplomatic information, they apparently didn’t seem so to President Obama.::::::::At least that might be concluded from the revelation that Obama learned about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s controversial e-mail system like the rest of us: through news reports this past week, as he told CBS in a weekend interview broadcast Sunday.::::::::Without indicating any particular concern, Obama told Bill Plante: ""I'm glad that Hillary’s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.""::::::::""I think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need,"" he said. ""The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.”::::::::True, Obama’s message traffic no doubt is highly filtered, so he may never have had the opportunity to note her e-mail address. Remember when the Secret Service took control of his personal Blackberry about 10 seconds after he was sworn in as President?::::::::Once the controversy became known, Clinton tweeted: “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.”::::::::The problem is, that review could take weeks or months. Those e-mails total 55,000 pages, and as Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post wrote the other day, “Those are the e-mails that Clintonworld decided should be turned over…. not exactly the classic definition of transparency.”::::::::Meanwhile, the special House committee probing the terrorist attack on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, has issued subpoenas for some of Clinton's personal e-mails, and the Associated Press says it’s considering legal action for long delays on its Freedom of Information Act requests for records related to Clinton’s tenure at the Department of State.::::::::To political professionals and the reporters who follow them, the 2016 presidential election may be just around the corner. To the typical voter, it’s many months off, and they aren’t paying much attention.::::::::Clinton leads in all the polls – both against any potential Democratic challengers and against any Republican hopefuls.::::::::In the latest Real Clear Politics polling average of Democrats, she gets more than four times as many votes as the next two (Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren). In a mock general election, she beats all Republicans by landslide margins.::::::::But as Bloomberg reports, “Her use of a private server for her communications has prompted concern over the security of sensitive information that may have been e-mailed to Clinton. It also has fed into perceptions of secrecy that grew out of the Clinton White House, when the then-first lady fought efforts to turn over documents related to the Whitewater investigation and her health-care task force.”::::::::Writing in Politico.com under the headline “Hillary in Nixon’s Shadow,” Todd Purdum also touches on an aspect of Clinton’s history and character that seems to go beyond the current flap.::::::::“The real damage from the email controversy,” he writes, “may lie less in any specific embarrassing revelations (though if history is any guide, there are bound to be some) than in the seeming proof that the aspect of Clinton’s personality that is suspicious, defensive, contemptuous of the press and scornful of political adversaries will never change.”::::::::The results of a new Fox News poll, taken as the e-mail news broke, are likely to be seen by Clinton supporters as biased given the source. But they may portend an increasing challenge for her.::::::::“The poll was also taken while Clinton is being dogged by allegations of an apparent conflict of interest stemming from the Clinton Foundation taking foreign donations at the same time Clinton was secretary of state,” the International Business Times reports. “On honesty, 44 percent of voters polled said the trait describes Clinton, a drop of 10 percentage points from the 54 percent who in April 2014 said Clinton was honest and trustworthy. A little more than half of respondents in Thursday’s poll said Clinton wasn’t honest and trustworthy.”"

The matter was compounded after further reports surfaced, alleging that the personal account Clinton used was run out of a private internet server based in her Chappaqua, N.Y. home.::::::::While Clinton tweeted last Wednesday that she wanted all her emails made public, to help quell concerns over transparency, she has remained largely silent on the issue — a fact that is frustrating even her fellow Democrats.::::::::“I would like her to come forward and just say what the situation is. She is the leading candidate, be it Republican or Democrat, to be the next president, and I think she needs to step up and come out and say exactly what the situation is,” Democratic Sen.

"31812"	"2015-03-08"	"Will Private Emails Hurt Hillary's Chances in 2016? Video"	"Oh, a week of stories over Hillary Clinton's e-mails capped by that skit on ""Saturday night live."" Now it's become a pretty familiar pattern but will this story evaporate like so many in the past or does it spell real trouble for the upcoming campaign? Jon Karl examines those questions in our ""Closer look."" Hi, everybody. Reporter: Last night Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea got a rousing welcome at a meeting of the Clinton global initiative. Hillary Clinton didn't say anything about the topic du jour but president Obama did telling CBS he was unaware that she conducted official business using personal e-mail. When did he learn about it? The same time everybody else earn learned it through news reports. Reporter: The president praised secretary Clinton as a great secretary of state but made it clear he does not handle his e-mail the way she did. My e-mails, the blackberry that I carry around, all those records are available. Reporter: The president said he is glad Mrs. Clinton has now turned over her e-mails but there's still plenty of democratic angst some of it from those closest to president Obama. Why did she use a separate e-mail? How did she secure that? By not answering these questions, they're allowing the story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. Reporter: The issues now swirling this morning, how did Clinton break the rules? State department policy during her time as secretary of state required that if state employees use private e-mail for official business, they must turn it over to be entered on government computers. Mrs. Clinton did not do that until nearly two years after she stepped down as secretary and then only e-mails selected by her staff. And then there are the ghosts of Clinton's past. The new dustup brings up past controversies including secrecy and the Clintons. The secret health care task force that worked with her on the failed effort to pass a health care reform bill in the early 1990s. The rose law firm billing records that mysteriously went missing for two years when she was first lady finally turning up in the private residence of the white house. Here's what Mrs. Clinton said back in those days about more low-tech recordkeeping. Are you keeping a are you keeping good notes of what's happening to you? Heavens no. It would get subpoenaed. I can't write anything down. Reporter: The big political question, what is the impact on campaign 2016? The last time she ran for president, Mrs. Clinton did have something to say about secret e-mails when they belonged to republicans. We know about the secret wiretaps. We know about the secret military tribunals. Secret white house e-mail accounts. Reporter: But now that it's her secret e-mails, Mrs. Clinton seems to have been caught flat-footed. Not a good sign for a soon-to-be presidential campaign. For ""This week,"" Jonathan Karl, ABC news, Washington. Thank you. Let's talk about this now with the team from Bloomberg politic, John heilemann and mark Halperin and our dueling strategists, donna Brazile and Nicolle Wallace from ""The view"" who worked for both George W. And Jeb bush. Welcome to you all and, mark, let me begin with you. I think we've seen a version of this story that Jon Karl hinted at five or six times. Generally the Clintons underreact and hunker down, the critics and media overreact. Is it different this time? Will it make any difference? I said a few weeks ago on this show I thought she was easily the most likely president of the United States. I now think not only is she because of this as a symptom and a cause, I now think she's not only easily the most likely, I don't think she's any more than most likely. This is -- go that's a big shift. Yeah. Because of e-mails? A big shift. Because of what this says as a symptom. Exhale. Not as a cause, as a symptom. Exhale. What she's doing here in terms of lack of response, lack of a sense of what people think of her and combined with what I thought was an extraordinary weak performance at her speech the other day, her husband can get through these things because he's a politician of a lifetime. She cannot. If this is the way she's going to run her operation, if this is the mind-set she's going to have, I don't think she's going to be president. The problem with, of course, recording anything about the Clintons is we overexploit it then we talk about it until we find something else to talk about. Reporters are looking through the rear view mirror to see if that's any way to manage her campaign or run the white house. We've known for two years secretary Clinton used a private e-mail account. That was the norm for cabinet officials and government officials and, yet, you know, we've used this week to talk about how is she going to use this to talk about everything else? I think she will survive it. I think she will overcome it. I think when she announces if she announces, this will not be part of the conversation. That may be, but, donna, let me bring this question to Nicolle Wallace. I guess that begs the question of why not get ahead of it. If you knew you were responding to the request of the state department, responding to the request from congressional committees why not be more public about what you were dog? I think their calculation is -- if you want to know what it's like to run for a president as a republican, watch what Hillary Clinton is going through. The media hyperventilation over everything the Clintons do reminds me so much of how they treated bush and Cheney and I said earlier this week and I thought someone's head was going to explode in the media. This is a media problem for her, no doubt. Journalism and journalists view themselves as the safeguard and the guardians of the public interest. They think the public has an interest and so do the republicans on the benghazi select committee. But these were e-mails. Not encrypted NSA taps. They will eventually come out and I think what's instructive to me is how the media is now writing her off because she didn't turn over her e-mails. We don't know yet if this is a political problem but it is most certainly a media problem. Okay, John heilemann, Hillary Clinton has been hurt with mark Halperin, how about democrats? You're not seeing a big uprising among democrats. Maybe some anxiety behind the scenes. Look, we're at the point of the campaign right now where on both sides this is about really the establishment, right? This is not -- voters are hardly engaged on either side but at this moment it not just this e-mail thing and I'm not quite as pessimistic as mark or I've changed my views about her quite as much but this story comes on the back of the stories about foreign donors at the foundation, it comes on the story about other questions about the foundation and business groups that were giving to it. She's had an extraordinarily bad run. This is a punctuation of some number of weeks of stories that are damaging to her because they go to the whole massive questions that are now going to get asked and looked into. This story is going to go on for a long time because of the fact that the subpoenas are being issued, because of the fact there's still e-mails she kept on her private server that respect even the ones she turned over to the state department. There are huge questions and for establishment democrats I think the answer, George, to answer your question is, I think for establishment democrats it increases what has been a persistent unease about her from 2008 that still lingers from 2016. That unease to open the door to Barack Obama eight years ago. I don't know if there's anybody awake in the wings right now, but I know a lot of establishment democrats getting that kind of queasy feeling in their stomach again that they had back in 2007 and 2008. Martin O'Malley stepping up his activity this week although not speaking on this but gets to the question, mark Halperin, what does secretary Clinton do about it? Does it speed up her plans to get in? Does she change her operation? Does she turn over all e-mails to the national archives. If I may respond quickly to two things Nicolle said. The press does have an obligation. This is not just a political story. What she did, withholding documents not available for subpoenas or requests is regardless of party. That is not -- I disagree with that. We're talking about political consequences. I think it's -- We're also talking about what's right and how government is supposed to -- It's far more devastating to say to Diane sawyer I was flat broke. People understand that those riding in a limo for two decades is flat broke. I'm sure she has political problems. I'm not sure that making the media mad is one of them. I'll just say, she's still -- any democrat who is nominated will have huge advantages. She's still an extraordinarily strong figure and raise a lot of money, et cetera. I don't know what she'll do. Our reporting from our colleague Jennifer Epstein was they think her saying it's up to the state department and cannot address it, I think she must -- She expects those e-mails to be released. She expects every last one of those -- But, donna, what else did she do -- Look, her personal -- what she needs to do -- We don't know. Let donna. She must -- You say speak publicly. What should she do? First of all, she should start talking about the economy and start talking about, you know, all of the important issues facing the country. She needs to get out here and run a campaign if she's going to run, and she should not worry about what the 300 e-mails that the house benghazi committee is looking at. Look, she is a strong candidate. And let me just tell you, there's nobody in the democratic party I just talked to and we just had a big democratic meet meeting and I heard from governors and others, nobody is drinking pepto-bismol right now.

"31820"	"2015-03-08"	"6 questions for Clinton on e-mail controversy"	"Hillary Clinton’s decision to use a private e-mail address exclusively — and set up her own server at her house to do so — during her time as the nation’s leading diplomat has dominated news coverage for a week.::::::::Yet for all the great reporting that has been done, there are lots of questions that remain unanswered, either by journalists looking into the matter or, much less likely, by Clinton herself.::::::::I put my head together with a few other reporters on The Washington Post’s national politics staff — Roz Helderman and others — to brainstorm a list of questions that Clinton and her team either haven’t answered entirely or at all.::::::::1. Why did Clinton set up this e-mail system?::::::::This is the biggie. Other secretaries of state — Colin Powell! — have maintained a private e-mail address, but no one has used such a setup exclusively. So why did Clinton, particularly given that she had to know that it might become an issue if or when she ran for president in 2016? (No, Clinton probably wasn’t thinking about 2016 at the start of 2009, but by the middle of her term, it was quite clear that another run for president was a real possibility.)::::::::Did she simply want to have as much control over her e-mail correspondence as possible? If so, why? Was there any political motivation in her decision, perhaps to shield some of her communication from Republicans? Did she consider a private e-mail server more secure from hacking than the government one? If so, who advised her on this?::::::::Those are questions no one but Clinton can answer. But it’s not clear she has any plans to do so.::::::::2. How many e-mails did Clinton send from her private account during her four years at the State Department?::::::::Clinton World has shipped 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department. That much we know. What we don’t know is how many more pages of e-mails exist. Here’s what we do know, from a Post report Thursday:::::::::“Of the e-mails that were turned over to State, the Clinton aide said, 90 percent were correspondence between Clinton and agency employees using their regular government e-mail accounts, which end in state.gov.::::::::“The remaining 10 percent were communications between Clinton and other government officials, including some at the White House, along with an unknown number of people ‘not on a government server,’ the aide said.”::::::::That doesn’t, of course, answer the more basic question: Is 55,000 the entirety of the e-mails Clinton sent? Half? A third? Obviously, if it’s 95 percent, that’s something very different from if it’s 35 percent.::::::::3. What did Clinton mean with her tweet?::::::::On Wednesday night, Clinton tweeted this: “I want the public to see my e-mail. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.”::::::::But did she mean that she wants the State Department to release the 55,000 pages she sent the department? Or all of her e-mails? If it’s the latter, the burden of releasing them rests with Clinton, not the State Department. And, to reiterate Question No. 2, just how many of the e-mails she sent does the State Department not have?::::::::4. Who was in charge of deciding which e-mails Clinton sent to the State Department for archiving?::::::::What we know is that someone (or some people) in Clinton’s orbit went through the e-mails to decide which ones should be shipped to the State Department. The supposed standard for withholding e-mails was that they were “personal.” But, without knowing who was in charge of this selection process and what criteria they used to decide what constituted a personal e-mail, it’s impossible to get to the bottom of what the State Department has or, more importantly, should have.::::::::5. Did anyone at the State Department or the White House raise concerns about Clinton’s exclusive use of the private e-mail system?::::::::This is from Edward-Isaac Dovere’s article at Politico on Friday:::::::::“The White House, State Department and Hillary Clinton’s personal office knew in August that House Republicans had received information showing that the former secretary of state conducted official government business through her private e-mail account — and Clinton’s staff made the decision to keep quiet.::::::::“Sources familiar with the discussions say key people in the Obama administration and on Clinton’s staff were aware that the revelation could be explosive for the all-but-announced candidate for president. But those involved deferred to Clinton’s aides, and they decided not to respond.”::::::::The larger question is did anyone — at the State Department or the White House — raise a red flag earlier about her e-mail being a problem before it became clear that this information had fallen into the hands of Republican congressional investigators?::::::::If someone did, what was Clinton’s response? Or did the matter never get all the way to her? If no one raised an alarm, why not?::::::::6. How do we know there was no classified material in those e-mails? What about “sensitive” material, and if they did include “sensitive” material, did her e-mail system meet State Department security requirements for the exchange of such information?::::::::Here’s what we know about what was in the e-mails Clinton sent, via the New York Times:::::::::“While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clinton’s e-mails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any ‘sensitive’ information.::::::::“Sensitive information is different from classified information. It can be personal data, like Social Security numbers, or information on matters that other countries consider classified or important to their national security.”::::::::So there “does not appear” to be any classified information contained therein, but it remains to be seen whether there was “sensitive” information. That sounds as if the State Department is giving itself lots of wiggle room.::::::::It may turn out that no classified or even “sensitive” information was transmitted, but it’s quite clear that we — and the State Department — don’t know that yet. And since we don’t know that, we also don’t know whether there was ever a conversation between Clinton and State Department officials about how and whether she could send this sort of information via a private e-mail server."
"31830"	"2015-03-08"	"Feinstein: Hillary Clinton should speak out about e-mails"	"Sen. Dianne Feinstein called on Hillary Rodham Clinton to provide more details about her use of a private e-mail account to conduct government business while she was secretary of State.::::::::“What I would like is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is,” Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “Because she is the pre-eminent political figure right now. She is the leading candidate, whether it be Republican or Democrat … to be the next president. And I think she needs to step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is.”::::::::Clinton tweeted last week that she wants the public to see her e-mails and that she asked the State Department to release them. Clinton’s post on Twitter has been her only comment since the New York Times revealed her use of the private e-mail system.::::::::State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf has said Clinton’s use of a non-governmental e-mail account was not prohibited at the time as long as Clinton kept records of her electronic communications. Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department, the department has said.::::::::Feinstein’s remarks Sunday are among the strongest to date from a Democrat about the controversy.::::::::The California senator has long been an ally of Clinton, and provided her home as a meeting place for Clinton and President Obama to iron out their differences after the bruising 2008 Democratic primaries. Feinstein also signed onto a letter with the other female Democratic senators in support of a Clinton presidential bid.::::::::“From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her,” Feinstein said on Meet the Press.::::::::The House Select Committee on Benghazi has about 300 pages of e-mails from Clinton and issued individual subpoenas last week to Clinton and to the State Department for the rest.::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the select committee, said Sunday there are “huge gaps” as they relate to Clinton’s e-mails and his panel’s investigation of the deadly attack in 2012 on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.::::::::“There are gaps of months and months and months,” Gowdy said on CBS’ Face the Nation.::::::::He made reference to an iconic photo of Clinton, wearing dark sunglasses and checking her BlackBerry, that was taken aboard a military transport plane as she was headed to Libya.::::::::“We have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip,” Gowdy said, suggesting it’s a stretch “to believe that if you’re on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there’s not a single document that has been turned over to Congress … It’s not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what is a public record and what’s not.”::::::::Gowdy added: “We’re not entitled to everything. I don’t want everything. I just want everything related to Libya and Benghazi.”"
"31851"	"2015-03-08"	"5 questions: The Clinton email"	"After a week of drip-drip of details regarding Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email account, the response from allies of the former secretary of state has not come close to satisfying political critics trying to make sense of the arrangement.::::::::The email saga dogging Clinton’s all-but-announced campaign isn’t expected to end anytime soon and a lot remains unknown. The State Department is expected to take months to review the 55,000 pages of emails the presumed 2016 Democratic front-runner turned over last year and recently requested to be released to the public, and Republicans will likely keep Clinton’s use of the personal email account for government business — which was first revealed by The New York Times — in the spotlight for as long as possible.::::::::As we wait for more details to emerge, here are POLITICO’s five big questions that remain outstanding:::::::::1. Did anyone give Clinton the green light to use personal email in 2009 and was the issue discussed when she was leaving the department?::::::::Clinton defenders have repeatedly pointed to past secretaries of state who used personal email accounts and have argued that no laws or rules were violated because they were fuzzy until recently. But none of the former secretaries from the email era used personal accounts almost exclusively as Clinton did during her tenure.::::::::The department, as POLITICO previously reported, has also had a “general policy” against the routine use of personal email since 2005, raising questions about the origins of the arrangement that allowed Clinton to rely on her personal account. While a 2012 State inspector general’s report called the policy “clear cut,” State officials now insist it applied only to information designated as sensitive. Still, Clinton’s practice seems to be in tension with the Obama administration’s professed focus on transparency. (President Barack Obama told CBS News this weekend he learned of Clinton’s use of personal email the “same time everybody else learned it” through news reports.)::::::::If the department officials were aware of Clinton’s personal email use, presumably, there was also a discussion when Clinton was leaving the department about preserving her email records. The beginning and end of Clinton’s use of the unofficial account while at the State Department could reveal the reasoning behind her reliance on a private account and explain the time lag between Clinton leaving office and a letter requesting her personal emails for record-keeping.::::::::2. What’s in the emails, and what wasn’t turned over?::::::::The contents of Clinton’s emails and the sensitivity of the information she shared on her personal account will continue to dominate the attacks from Clinton’s critics until the emails have been released.::::::::Cybersecurity experts have raised concern over the security of using Clinton’s personal server for government business, and Republicans have seized on that line of attack. But the State Department has said officials do not believe Clinton used her account to discuss classified information because that information was usually printed out for Clinton and shown to her on paper.::::::::Questions also remain about who precisely decided which of Clinton’s emails were work-related, what standard they applied, and what kinds of records were left out of the 55,000 page set.::::::::“It wasn’t spreadsheets for her daughter’s wedding, but it was anything related to official business,” State spokeswoman Marie Harf said Friday, while acknowledging Clinton’s aides made the decisions about what to fork over and what to hold back.::::::::Even when the contents of many of the emails are finally revealed to the public, a lingering question will go unresolved, especially if the messages are mundane: Why wasn’t the information stored at the State Department from the start?::::::::3. How much did the State Department’s request to former secretaries for additional records last year have to do with Benghazi?::::::::Initially, the State Department maintained that an unusual letter it had sent to former secretaries requesting copies of all work-related emails that they sent or received on private accounts had nothing to do with a House Select Committee on Benghazi’s investigation into the 2012 attacks in Libya. But on Friday, Harf conceded that the committee’s investigation was one of many factors that led the department to issue the request that resulted in Clinton sending the State Department emails she exchanged on her personal account.::::::::“Certainly, that’s a factor, but … as we’ve said now a few times, it was not any one thing that prompted this,” Harf said at a daily briefing. “It would be grossly simplistic to say that any one thing prompted us to send this letter.”::::::::The Benghazi investigation has drawn criticism for months, not just from Democrats but also Republicans who believed House GOP botched the process politically. If the letter were a result of the investigation, it would show gaps in the State Department’s and Clinton’s record-keeping efforts, particularly if the personal emails were collected only when prodded by Congress for an unrelated investigation.::::::::4. What role did Eric Hothem play in all this (and does it matter)?::::::::The mystery man connected to Clinton’s personal email account was revealed last week to be Eric Hothem, a former aide in the Clinton administration who is now a Washington, D.C., stockbroker with J.P. Morgan.::::::::Clinton reportedly used an email domain registered to her home in Chappaqua, New York, and public records indicated “Eric Hoteham” was responsible for setting up the server. Hoteham is now believed to be a garbled version of Hothem, who was also linked to Clinton controversies when the family first left the White House in 2001. Hothem has not spoken to the media since being tied to the server and little is known about his work for the Clintons.::::::::It’s still unclear whether the server was at Clinton’s home, for how long it was set up there and whether the emails were also stored off site. Hothem could provide more information on how any server in the Clinton’s house operated amid the swirling security and logistical questions related to the former secretary’s use of the unofficial account.::::::::5. What are the chances other congressional committees will get involved and obtain and release all 55,000 pages of emails?::::::::Since Congress is not bound by FOIA rules, it could release the 55,000 pages of personal emails Clinton turned over much more quickly and with fewer redactions than the State Department. But the State Department has sent only a fraction of that — roughly 300 emails, totaling 900 pages – to the House committee on Benghazi, which most likely doesn’t have authority to subpoena the full set of emails because it has a narrow jurisdiction.::::::::However, other committees, such as the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Oversight and Government Reform Committee or their Senate counterparts, could get involved and subpoena more of the emails since they have broad jurisdiction over State. There are already some rumblings of the House Foreign Affairs Committee launching an investigation."
"31860"	"2015-03-08"	"Hillary Clinton emails: Some in GOP resist overreach"	"If there's potency to Clinton's close guard of her emails, using a personal address on a private server to keep strict control of what's made public, it's that the ordeal makes her look secretive and untrustworthy -- exactly the line of attack Republicans have been employing against her for decades.::::::::READ: Bill Clinton declines to weigh in on Hillary's emails::::::::But House GOP investigators' eagerness to put Clinton in their crosshairs and keep the details of her latest scandal front-and-center is a reminder that they face a risk, too: Turning Clinton into a sympathetic figure, instead of allowing her to do the damage herself.::::::::Over the years, Congress and the Clintons have gone a number of rounds. And while the Clintons have endured, past congressional Republicans have been burned.::::::::Newt Gingrich was at the top of the political world when he became speaker of the House in 1994. Four years and a Monica Lewinsky investigation and Bill Clinton impeachment later, Gingrich was done.::::::::More recently, the GOP's unchecked desire to attack its least-favorite Democrats has backfired with President Barack Obama in office, too -- most recently when a push to use Department of Homeland Security funding as leverage to undercut Obama on immigration failed. Facing self-imposed political fallout, House Republicans were forced to concede just hours before the key anti-terrorism agency was to shut down.::::::::That the right was champing at the bit to go after Clinton over her private emails was evident this weekend.::::::::SEE ALSO: Jeb Bush must win over conservatives, poll shows::::::::Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Saturday in Iowa that the Justice Department should ""absolutely"" investigate whether Clinton broke the law by exclusively using a personal email address on a private server.::::::::The attacks continued on Sunday news programs. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, chairman of the House panel investigating the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that ""there are gaps of months and months and months"" in the Clinton emails the State Department has turned over.::::::::""If you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya -- she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand -- we have no emails from that day. In fact, we have no emails from that trip,"" Gowdy said.::::::::Another House Republican investigator said he's been frustrated with Clinton for years. Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who previously helmed the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, complained on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Clinton ""wasn't forthcoming two and a half years ago"" when his panel subpoenaed her records related to Benghazi.::::::::""She, in fact, hid the very existence of this until she was caught,"" he said on Sunday.::::::::Other Republicans, though, took a softer approach to Clinton.::::::::Among them was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who said during an appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that his concern is the security of the former secretary of state's emails.::::::::""They would have been prime targets for cyberattacks,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""But I don't know what the law is. I think the administration is taking a look at that. And, hopefully, we will find out in the coming weeks just what the legal situation is.""::::::::Another risk for Republicans is sullying their own presidential candidates in the dig for Clinton dirt.::::::::Jeb Bush, while he was governor of Florida, often used a personal email address connected to a home-brew server -- and, like Clinton, gave his top aides addresses, too. It has allowed him an unusual level of control over what's released and what's kept private.::::::::Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and his aides set up their own private internal email system while he was a Milwaukee County executive, and mixed official government business with campaign politics. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his aides' private communications became a focus of the ""Bridgegate"" investigation. Texas Gov. Rick Perry sometimes used a personal address, too.::::::::Senators, such as Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Cruz of Texas, don't have much room to talk, either, since Congress exempts itself from federal open records laws.::::::::Only Clinton, after all, was working on high-wire diplomacy as secretary of state, though she has said none of her emails contained any classified information.::::::::Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- who drew on The Godfather's Michael Corleone to describe his home-state battles with the Clintons, saying ""it's not personal, it's just business"" -- argued on ""Fox News Sunday"" the emails are part of Clinton's bigger image problems.::::::::""Once this shadow of doubt has been placed, I think it's going to linger throughout a presidential campaign, should she decide to run,"" Huckabee said.::::::::He said Clinton may ultimately be forced to bring in an independent agent to inspect the emails from her time as secretary of state and confirm that she's released each one connected to her official role, rather than allowing Clinton and her staff to take the lead.::::::::""If you're depending upon somebody who is under investigation to be in charge of the investigation, you don't have much of an investigation,"" Huckabee said. ""It just doesn't have the credibility.""::::::::But even the prospect of a so-called independent investigation can carry risk.::::::::Back in the 1990s when the Clintons were under investigation, House Republicans were undermined in the public's eyes in part because their lead investigator -- Kenneth Starr -- conducted such an overtly political quest. Starr was appointed by a three-judge panel to investigate the suspicious death of a top White House official and a real estate investment deal known as Whitewater. But his years-long inquiry expanded to Bill Clinton's personal life and exposed the Lewinsky affair.::::::::A move to find a truly independent investigator by the GOP this time around would go far in giving Republican attacks on any findings more credibility and thus political potency. At least some in the GOP seem to have taken these past lessons into account as they head into their next face-off with the Clintons."
"31884"	"2015-03-08"	"Feinstein wants Clinton to provide details on personal e-mail use"	"Feinstein wants Clinton to provide details on personal e-mail use::::::::WASHINGTON — Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Sunday on Hillary Clinton to “step up and come out” to explain in more detail why she used a personal e-mail account to conduct government business during her time as secretary of state.::::::::The comments, coming from the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, are some of the most forceful that Clinton has faced from a prominent member of her party since questions about her e-mail use flared up last week.::::::::“What I would like is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is, because she is the preeminent political figure right now,” Feinstein said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The senator called Clinton the “leading candidate” for president.::::::::Feinstein did not accuse Clinton of any wrongdoing, but she suggested that Clinton “needs to step up and come out.” She added: “I think from this point on the silence is going to hurt her.”::::::::Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail account was reported last week by the New York Times. Since then, a special House committee investigating the 2012 fatal attack at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, has issued subpoenas for information on her e-mails.::::::::Clinton handed over 55,000 pages of e-mails last year to the State Department after the agency asked her to turn over public records she was holding. They are reviewing her submissions.::::::::Many Republicans have raised questions about whether Clinton’s practices complied with government rules and have accused her of being overly secretive. While her surrogates and a spokesman have been defending her actions, Clinton has offered little direct input on the matter.::::::::“I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” she tweeted last week.::::::::Feinstein has signed a letter encouraging Clinton to run for president.::::::::In an interview with CBS News published Saturday, President Obama said he learned that Clinton used her personal e-mail for government business “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”::::::::In an interview on CBS’ “Face The Nation,” Rep. Trey Gowd, R-S.C., who chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said, “It’s not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what’s a public record and what is not.”::::::::Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, who also sits on the Select Committee on Benghazi, defended Clinton and said it was “deeply disturbing” to see the committee issue subpoenas, arguing, “we have the secretary’s e-mails.

"31921"	"2015-03-08"	"Obama: 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton's email address'"	"President Barack Obama last night prompted renewed Republican calls for an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state after saying he was unaware she had declined to use an official email account during her four years in office.::::::::Asked when he had first learned of Mrs Clinton’s decision to use an email account based on a private server over which she had total control, Mr Obama replied: “The same time everybody else learned it, through news reports.”::::::::Mr Obama did not explain how or why he did not notice Mrs Clinton was using a “clintonemail.com” address, but supported his former secretary of state and Democrat front-runner for the 2016 presidential elections who is now facing multiple subpoena requests for emails from a Republican-controlled congressional committee.::::::::“She was a great secretary of state for me,” Mr Obama told CBS News, adding that his own emails were “available and archived” and that he was glad that Mrs Clinton had agreed last year to hand 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department for release.::::::::However Mrs Clinton, who is expected to announce a final run for the White House within weeks, remains under fire for her decision to use a “homebrew” server, raising questions over whether she had broken US government guidelines on record-keeping.::::::::Except for a single Tweet last week saying that “I want the public to see my email”, Mrs Clinton has declined to explain why she refused to have a “ state.gov” email address, leaving even some Democrats frustrated at her failure to address the issue.::::::::The pressure on Mrs Clinton was turned up a notch on Sunday when Dianne Feinstein, a California senator, became the first senior Democrat to break ranks and call for the party’s presumptive nominee in 2016 to clear the air.::::::::Mrs Feinstein said that she believed Mrs Clinton needed to “step up and come out” to explain her reasoning to the public or risk the issue potentially poisoning her candidacy.::::::::“She is the leading candidate, whether it be Republican or Democrat, for the next president,” she told NBC News, “From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her.”::::::::Senior Republicans continued to use the emails story to raise questions about Mrs Clinton’s judgment in office and her handling of the attack by Islamic militants on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya in 2012 which left the US ambassador and three other Americans dead.::::::::A Republican-controlled Congressional committee investigating the attack last week issued blanket subpoenas for all Mrs Clinton’s emails while secretary of state, leading to accusations from Democrats that they were mounting a politically motivated 'fishing expedition’ against her.::::::::Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman and former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee that first subpoenaed emails in 2012, said Mrs Clinton would have committed a crime if it emerged that “she knowingly withheld” Benghazi-related emails following that subpoena.::::::::Mr Issa told CNN that he believed Mrs Clinton “wasn’t forthcoming two and a half years ago” after the Benghazi attack. “She, in fact, hid the very existence of this until she was caught,” he added.::::::::The Republican chairman of the congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attack said that ""huge gaps"" remained in the record, including from Mrs Clinton's trip to Libya after the attack.::::::::""We have no emails from that day. In fact we have no emails from that trip,"" Congressman Trey Gowdy told CBS News, ""There are huge gaps.""::::::::Democrats in turn accused Republicans of muckraking, pointing out that new Federal guidelines mandating all officials to use government addresses had not come into force until Mrs Clinton had left office.::::::::“What is the law at the time? The law at the time was that she could use her personal email as long as she preserved it,” said Adam Schiff, a Democrat who sits on the House committee on Benghazi, adding “she clearly did preserve her emails.”::::::::Whatever the ultimate truth of the allegations, the questions over Mrs Clinton’s email habits continue to be an unwelcome distraction for the Clintons as they prepare for a 2016 presidential run.::::::::Mrs Clinton, speaking at a Clinton Foundation event in Miami over the weekend pointedly declined to discuss the issue.::::::::Bill Clinton, speaking at the same event, did however address concern that the couple’s charitable foundation had taken high-value donations from foreign governments with questionable human rights records, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, while Mrs Clinton was serving as America’s top diplomat.::::::::“My theory about all this is disclose everything. And then let people make their judgments,” Mr Clinton said, leading several of the Clintons critics to note the irony that this was not policy Mrs Clinton had - thus far - apparently adopted over her emails."

Also on CBS, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he did not know if Mrs. Clinton’s email violated the law, but said he was concerned about the security of her private account.::::::::“They would have been prime targets for cyberattacks,” Mr. McConnell said.::::::::Democrats remained on the defensive over the situation, given Mrs. Clinton’s status as their presumed presidential nominee despite not having formally announced her intentions to run.::::::::Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said Mrs. Clinton must “step up” and explain why she had used a private email address during her time as secretary of state, increasing the pressure on Mrs. Clinton to publicly address the matter.::::::::“I think that she needs to step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is,” Ms. Feinstein said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press, adding, “From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her.”::::::::Ms. Feinstein’s comments were notably more pointed than earlier in the week when, in an interview in the Capitol, she said she did not think there was “any ill intent” on Mrs. Clinton’s part and counseled patience.::::::::Many senior Democrats appear anxious and said they hoped Mrs. Clinton would offer some clarity about why she had used her own email account to conduct government business.::::::::Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, attempted to tone down the rhetoric, calling it a political attack that would soon blow over.::::::::“I think at the end of the day this will just be regarded as a slight hiccup, a small bump in the road six months from now,” Mr. Schumer told CBS. “The bottom line is she’s a national figure, a potential presidential candidate. People are going to shoot at her.”::::::::Mrs. Clinton has so far only said in a post on Twitter that she wants the public to see her emails. Over the weekend, the controversy spilled over into the world of comedy when “Saturday Night Live” featured the dust-up.::::::::Impersonating Mrs. Clinton sitting on a couch, the comedian Kate McKinnon said the contents of her email were no big deal.::::::::“Those emails are clean as a whistle,” she said. “This is not how Hillary Clinton goes down.”"
"32003"	"2015-03-09"	"Who should be in charge of handing over Hillary Clinton's emails?"	"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging the State Department to release the emails she wrote from a private account during her tenure at the head of the State Department. The special committee House Republicans created last year to investigate the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, want those emails.::::::::The State Department, which has served as the middleman in the email-transfer process, is now coming under fire. They received 55,000 pages of documents from Clinton in December, 900 of which - about 300 emails - they turned over to the Benghazi committee. Now, the committee has issued a subpoena for ""all communications"" Clinton had that were related to the Benghazi attacks. Committee chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, complained on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that there are ""gaps of months and months and months"" in records the committee has received from the State Department, and he no longer trusts the agency to determine what should and shouldn't be given to the committee. The subpoena was sent to Clinton's lawyer and to internet firms.::::::::A Republican aide to the Benghazi panel told CBS News that Gowdy is especially concerned about a gap between September 2011 and Jan 5, 2012, because in spite of a request for documents from a two-year period including that time span, the State Department produced only a single perfunctory email between Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills and the chief of mission in Libya. Clinton traveled to Libya during this period, and there is an iconic photo of her on a C-17 military plane checking her Blackberry. Republicans question the fact that the State Department did not turn over even one email from Clinton herself.::::::::Gowdy and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, among others, are convinced of the need for a third party to sort through the tens of thousands of pages of Clinton's correspondence, to determine what should be part of the official record, as well as figure out whether there are any more documents to be had.::::::::""I've lost confidence in the State Department to make that determination. They're the ones who allowed this arrangement. They're the ones who did nothing about this arrangement until they got a request from our committee,"" Gowdy said, referring to the fact that Clinton used only her personal email account rather than a government address while at the State Department. ""We're not entitled to everything. I don't want everything. I just want everything related to Libya and Benghazi.""::::::::On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Graham said, ""The one thing I'll never agree to is let the State Department tell us what e-mails we should receive or let her and her team tell us. Some independent group should do that.""::::::::So who exactly could take charge of this monumental task? That could be a job for an independent arbiter - a lawyer that both Clinton and the committee agree on or perhaps a former federal judge. The arbiter could be ""anybody theoretically they agreed to who is respected by both sides, will give them the right information but not give them more information"" than they need, former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Virginia, who served as the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2003 to 2007, told CBS News.::::::::It's a strategy former President Richard Nixon tried while he was under investigation for the Watergate scandal. Rather than handing over his secret recordings from inside the Oval Office to the special prosecutor's office, he proposed having Democratic Sen. John Stennis from Mississippi listen to the tapes and verify the White House summaries for the special prosecutors Archibald Cox's office.::::::::Both sides have to agree, though. Ultimately the Cox refused the offer, and Nixon forced his firing.::::::::One benefit to an arbiter that Davis identified is that it would take some of the edge off of a looming battle between Clinton and the committee.::::::::""They don't want to look too political about this thing,"" Davis said of the committee. He said he believes Gowdy ""wants to hold things together and come up with as factual a report as you can, and say this is what happened...you don't protect anybody, but you don't go after anybody in a needless way, either.""::::::::""This idea of an independent arbiter, that would be a compromise essentially,"" a former staff member for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee told CBS News. If Clinton's lawyers fight the subpoena, ""there could be a court proceeding...[and] the courts don't like to get involved.""::::::::Davis argued that avoiding a protracted legal battle actually helps Clinton if she does want to clear the air on the issue ahead of the 2016 run.::::::::""Running out the clock's really not an option,"" Davis said. ""Hillary can resist, they can go to court on this thing, it's just not really pretty for anyone involved at this point, and for her it's a complete distraction.""::::::::Even comedian Jon Stewart suggested a third party needs to take charge of the emails, likening the whole situation to Doritos revealing its ingredients on Wednesday's episode of ""The Daily Show.""::::::::""I think the concern there is the aides are the ones that get to decide which e-mails are appropriate to be shared as opposed to an independent arbiter,"" Stewart said. ""That's why Doritos doesn't get to decide which ingredients consumers need to know about or why you don't get to tell the cops which pockets to search.""::::::::The committee would still be responsible for verifying that Clinton had, in fact, handed over everything she was supposed to. Davis said that if he were running the committee, he would subpoena the private, ""home-brewed"" server Clinton reportedly used to run the email account. The former oversight committee staffer said that the Government Accountability Office or National Archives and Records Administration could determine whether anything had been deleted from the server.::::::::The committee's Democrats are already pushing back against the idea of a special arbiter.::::::::Republicans ""want a so-called independent reviewer to go through all of her personal emails, and they are basically suggesting that she is lying about turning over her official documents to the State Department,"" a spokesman for the committee's Democrats said in a statement. ""If Members of Congress have questions about the documents that have been produced or the process that was used, the appropriate steps utilized in congressional investigations are to pose those questions to an individual's attorney, ask the individual to provide a certification that all of the requested documents have been provided, and if necessary, ask the individual to confirm these facts in testimony under oath.""::::::::There is also not much precedent for an independent figure stepping into an investigation like this. Though independent arbiters are sometimes used when there are sensitive issues of privilege at hand in federal prosecutions, neither Davis nor the former oversight staffer could recall a situation when the committee resorted to that tactic for information.::::::::Clinton may not be ready to consider an arbiter. She has yet to even say anything publicly about her emails. But least one prominent Democratic ally thinks that she has to do something soon. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said on ""Meet the Press"" that Clinton ""needs to step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is ... I think, at this point, from this point on, the silence is going to hurt her."""

"32199"	"2015-03-09"	"Obama unknowingly corresponded with Hillary Clinton via private email address"	"“The president did email with Secretary Clinton,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters at his daily briefing. “He was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the records act.”::::::::This statement came two days after President Obama made the comment to CBS news that he learned about her private email system “The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” And has cast a doubt on whether or not Obama actually did know about Clintons private email or not.::::::::In a daily briefing, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Obama’s comments should not be interpreted as meaning that he did not know Clinton’s email address.::::::::“The point that the president was making is not that he didn’t know Secretary Clinton’s email address, he did,” Earnest said. “But he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act.”::::::::The question remains, however, how President Obama could have overlooked the fact that the email was not sent via the usual state.gov address used by state department issues. Mr. Earnest said on Monday that Mr. Obama “was aware of her email address,” but he was not aware that she used this for all of her official business and that it was a private server unconnected to the government.::::::::The fact remains that Clinton did not follow procedures set up by her own department, and no explanation has yet been set forth as to why procedures were not followed. It also has not been explained why President Obama did not take note of the fact that he and Clinton had been corresponding via unofficial channels, or the fact that nobody on Clinton’s staff or Obama’s team noticed the breach of protocol.::::::::The state department did not initially retain Clinton’s emails, but Clinton’s teams did recently turn over about 55,000 emails to the State Department as requested. However, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), this weekend said that there are gaps in the emails that Clinton submitted especially dealing with the 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.::::::::Gowdy says his committee lacked documentation from Clinton’s trip to Libya after the attack despite a popular photo image of her using a handheld device during a flight to that country.::::::::“We have no emails from that day. In fact we have no emails from that trip,” said Gowdy, who heads the committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. “There are huge gaps.”::::::::The State Department is currently still sifting through the large amount of emails obtained from Clinton’s team, before releasing them. It remains to be seen whether or not Clinton has broken any other protocols or is guilty of any wrong-doing other than not following those protocols set in place.::::::::It also remains to be seen whether Obama actually did not know about Clinton’s use of an unauthorized private email account, as he claims.::::::::There is much speculation on both sides as to whether there is something more nefarious going on here, or simply a lapse of judgment.::::::::It just seems odd to many that these high level correspondences between Obama and Clinton were not sent through official channels, and it seems odd that President Obama could be unaware of the fact that Clinton was using an unsecure email account."

At the daily briefing Monday, spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged that President Obama exchanged e-mails with Clinton during her tenure as his top diplomat.::::::::“The president did e-mail with Secretary Clinton,” Mr. Earnest said. But Mr. Obama wasn’t aware of how her e-mail system was set up or how her team was “planning to comply with the Federal Records Act,"" he added.::::::::Indeed, the law is on Clinton’s side. Since leaving the State Department, the federal law requiring officials to use government accounts for official communications has been updated. Now, officials cannot send e-mails from a private account unless they copy or forward the e-mails to their government e-mail address.::::::::On Sunday, a senior Democrat and Clinton friend called on her to address the e-mail matter publicly.::::::::“She needs to step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The silence is going to hurt her.”::::::::Other Democrats, such as Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, defend her, saying she complied with the law and that other secretaries of State also used private e-mails.::::::::But Clinton is hardly home free. Her image, boosted by her four years above the political fray as secretary of State, has been dinged. She’s now polling below 50 percent in hypothetical matchups with top Republicans for the presidency. The e-mail controversy, along with reports that the Clinton family foundation had accepted donations from foreign governments during her time as secretary, has brought back a long-running narrative by critics of Clinton: that she plays by her own rules and is less than transparent.::::::::Republicans investigating Clinton complain of gaps in the e-mails the State Department has turned over.::::::::""There are gaps of months, and months, and months,"" Rep. Trey Gowdy (R) of South Carolina said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He chairs the select House committee investigating the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi in 2012, which took place under Clinton’s watch.::::::::On Saturday, when former President Bill Clinton was asked about another matter – foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation – his response struck some as ironic: ""My theory about all of this is disclose everything, and then let people make their judgments,"" Clinton told moderator Larry Wilmore of Comedy Central in an interview Saturday at the Clinton Global Initiative University in Coral Gables, Fla.::::::::A skit on last weekend’s Saturday Night Live also didn’t do much for Mrs. Clinton’s image.::::::::""Those e-mails are clean as a whistle. This is not how Hillary Clinton goes down,"" said a wild-eyed Kate McKinnon as Clinton.::::::::Clinton made her only public comment to date on her e-mails last week, issuing a tweet calling for their release.::::::::It’s not clear when the release of the 55,000 pages of e-mail will happen. Clinton is expected to announce her presidential bid in April. That’s several weeks away and has left some Democrats worried that the issue will fester needlessly. But Team Clinton’s theory, according to news reports, is that “waiting out the storm” (following last Wednesday’s tweet) is the better approach.::::::::Her advisers hope that by the time she announces her campaign, “the controversy will have subsided to the point where her campaign launch will be a much bigger headline than her response to a month-old scandal,” Bloomberg News reported March 6. “An added benefit to the approach: the potential for Republicans to overreach and overreact while Clinton stays silent.”::::::::It is an approach that has served the Clintons well in the past. But in the current situation, it presupposes that nothing new will come out between now and her campaign launch that demands a reaction from her.::::::::Clinton benefits from being the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. And most Democrats aren’t paying attention to the e-mail flap – just 16 percent, the Pew Research Center reported Monday. Among Republicans, the figure is 34 percent."

"32233"	"2015-03-09"	"Mystery location of Clinton email server seen as 'matter of national security'"	"In the depths of the hacker and IT-blogger community, a skirmish has broken out over the nature of Hillary Clinton's email server -- a debate that could have profound implications for national security during Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, and for investigators hoping to mine her emails for evidentiary purposes.::::::::The questions center on where, exactly, Hillary Clinton’s email server is, or was, physically located; which private-sector firms may have been hosting it; and how secure Clinton’s emails were at any given point.::::::::Why does the physical location matter? Because if the server was not in Clinton’s home, and was maintained at some other site, then the secretary of state and the Diplomatic Security corps that guarded her were not in physical control of her server. This would have raised the possibility for compromise of Clinton’s account, either from an inside job, carried out by the very firm retained to host the server, or from external actors that could range from the Kremlin to China to independent hackers.::::::::In a March 6 post on his blog “And Still I Persist,” Bruce F. Webster, an IT expert with 30 years’ experience, and who has spent the last 15 years testifying on IT issues in civil litigation, posed the question “Where is (or was) the Clinton e-mail server?”::::::::Webster faulted news media organizations for failing to follow up on the Associated Press’ March 4 story that reported that Clinton’s private server was registered to her home address in Chappaqua, with the name of “Eric Hoteham” attached to it. Writes Webster:::::::::I have yet to find any news story that independently confirms the initial AP report, which itself appears to be based more on registration records for a particular static IP address (24.187.234.187) than actual evidence of the existence and location of a physical server. While those records contain the Clintons’ home address and the name ‘Eric Hoteham’, they don’t prove that this static IP address was ever in use at their home: one should not confuse a point-of-contact address with the actual location….[A]s far as I can tell, Clinton associates have never confirmed or denied the actual existence of a dedicated e-mail server hosting clintonemail.com at the Clinton home. It has been the media that has [sic] simply assumed the AP story to be accurate and has moved on from there.::::::::Examining the “IP address history” of clintonemail.com, Webster concluded there was “strong evidence” that Clinton’s domain had been hosted by two successive private-sector firms: ThePlanet.com, now known as SoftLayer and acquired in recent years by IBM; and Austin-based Confluence Networks, which Webster describes as “a hosting firm of very, very dubious provenance and management, to say the least.”::::::::This last conclusion would be of significance, if it were true that the reputation of a private-sector host was so poor as to raise questions about the security of Clinton’s emails. As to the physical location of Clinton’s server, the possibilities are very limited, as Webster writes:::::::::""There are strong security issues for all the solutions,"" Webster wrote. ""... If the e-mail server was really located in the Clinton Chappaqua home, was it left as a stand-alone server, or did anyone ever use it as a regular PC: reading e-mails, browsing the web, etc.? If the latter, then you have the very real possibility of malware being installed on the e-mail server itself. If the e-mail server was hosted in a private office somewhere, then it would need round the clock physical security. Who would provide that? The Secret Service? The State Department? Private contractors? If the e-mail server was hosted by an external hosting firm, then you have lost physical control of the server itself and have to depend upon the server farm facilities and operators to provide security.""::::::::He added that since Clinton used this email exclusively, ""there is a very good chance that foreign intelligence agencies became aware of it very quickly. ... And if the server was physically hosted in an industrial park somewhere in Texas (which matches another address associated with Confluence Networks), I’m willing to bet [foreign governments] could find their way in, particularly given that they had a few years to do so. So, once again, we’re back to a critical question: where was the Clinton e-mail server physically located? This is a question whose answer is, quite literally, a matter of national security.""::::::::In a March 7 post entitled “Confluence Networks Responds,” Webster posts the complete text of “panicked” message he received from Confluence, in which the firm stated flatly: “We do NOT and have never hosted the EMAIL for clintonemail.com, or that matter for the other MILLIONS of domain names that point to our infrastructure at any given point of time.”::::::::Fox News, based on information from a source in the hacker community, reported last week that Clinton created multiple email addresses under the same domain.::::::::That hacker, reviewing Webster's analysis, told Fox News that Webster ""is doing some good research"" but that information relating to IP addresses and DNS (domain name server) firms ""should be viewed skeptically ... particularly in relation to such a high profile domain as clintonemail.com now is"" because those records and addresses associated with domains ""are fungible and quite hackable.""::::::::The hacker also found a number of new email addresses appear to have been created for the clintonemail.com domain just since Fox News published the report. Now appearing alongside the real addresses, such as hdr22@clintonemail.com and the others Fox News revealed, are a number of new addresses that are clearly the work of hacker-prankster types. These faux addresses include herleadership@clintonemail.com, BigDogWillyC@clintonemail.com, and one that is unsuitable for publication. The hacker told Fox News these fake emails are an example of why IP and DNS data are so “fungible and quite hackable.”::::::::Webster, for his part, accepted the criticism of the hacker source and is updating his blog accordingly. Their consensus is that Confluence Networks may once have been where clintonemail.com was “parked,” but that the company’s declaration that it was never the host for Clinton’s server should be accepted at face value – even if, as Webster noted in an email to Fox News: “For a company that parks over a million domains, they provide very little information about who they are, who owns them, etc.” A cursory review of Confluence Networks’ rather primitive-looking website appears to bear this out.::::::::But Webster stresses the public still does not know the physical location of Clinton’s server, and because of that, does not have a firm handle on how secure its email contents were.::::::::James Rosen joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 1999.

"32353"	"2015-03-10"	"Clinton e-mails reinvigorate inquiry into allies who got special job status"	"The revelation that Hillary Rodham Clinton used a private e-mail system as secretary of state has revived a Senate investigation into another aspect of her tenure.::::::::Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who heads the Judiciary Committee, had previously questioned Clinton’s use of a program that allowed some political allies to work for the government while pursuing private-sector careers.::::::::Grassley had sought e-mails and other documents from the State Department.::::::::But he didn’t know until last week that Clinton was exclusively using a private e-mail account that could contain relevant information about her use of the so-called “special government employee” program. Huma Abedin, a Clinton confidante and adviser who was granted the special designation, also used the private e-mail system.::::::::Grassley has in recent days renewed his effort to get answers from the State Department. That opens a second line of inquiry on Capitol Hill into the Democrats’ presumptive presidential front-runner, who was already facing an inquiry from a House committee seeking her e-mails related to the U.S. response to an attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.::::::::Grassley and other critics have said Clinton’s use of the special employee program appeared unusual.::::::::State Department records show that a half-dozen of Clinton’s political allies were granted the special designation during her tenure. Not all of them received government salaries. But critics say abuse of the program could give private-sector firms unfair access to government information and internal deliberations.::::::::Spokesmen for Clinton and the State Department say her use of the program was appropriate and followed government rules. More than 100 people, most with expertise in niche areas of science and global affairs, received the designation each year.::::::::Asked to respond directly to Grassley’s concerns that Clinton may have misused the program, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill replied by e-mail: “With all due respect, we disagree.”::::::::No one knows how widely the program is used across the government. Grassley last year asked the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review. The assessment is not complete, but in the meantime, Grassley has focused his attention on Clinton and some of those who received the special designation under her leadership.::::::::Some recipients were political advisers with limited State Department expertise. Others, Grass­ley said, appeared to have turned the program on its head: Instead of being outside experts brought in to assist the government, they were State Department employees who launched secondary careers in the private sector while remaining tied to the department.::::::::“The public’s business ought to be public with few exceptions,” Grassley said in a statement Saturday. “When employees are allowed to serve the government and the private sector at the same time and use private email, the employees have access to everything and the public, nothing.”::::::::Grassley said he will press the State Department in the coming weeks “to answer for any blurring of the lines between public and private service and any concealing of the blurred lines through private email.”::::::::Questions about Clinton’s use of the special program were first raised in 2013, when it became public that Abedin was being paid by the State Department while also working for an international consulting firm with close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton.::::::::Through a request under the Freedom of Information Act, several news organizations, including The Washington Post, have since learned the extent to which Hillary Clinton used the program.::::::::Others granted the special status included a former campaign manager, a longtime legal and personal adviser, a former House member now affiliated with a group backing a Clinton presidential bid, a former pollster and others who have supported the Clintons in their political and philanthropic organizations.::::::::In interviews, State Department officials and several of the individuals said the special government status was legitimate and had no relationship to Hillary Clinton’s political ambitions. Some said they declined compensation for their work under the special status.::::::::Aside from Abedin, Clinton political allies who were granted the special status included Maggie Williams, Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager; Jeremy Rosner, a former Clinton pollster; Jonathan Prince, a speechwriter for Bill and Hillary Clinton; Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor who is on the board of American Bridge, a left-leaning political operation that has defended Hillary Clinton against partisan attacks; and Cheryl Mills, a former White House deputy counsel and longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton.::::::::Williams received the special status to work on issues relating to women and girls, State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach said. Williams did not respond to requests for comment.::::::::State Department documents show that Mills received no compensation for her work, which was tied to reconstruction efforts in Haiti. Mills did not respond to requests for comment. Merrill noted that Mills retained her affiliation with the department to work on Haiti after Clinton left.::::::::Prince also received no compensation for his work, which he said was tied to Middle East peace talks and unrelated to anything involving the Clintons. Townsend, who did not receive a government paycheck from her special designation, did not respond to requests for comment.::::::::Ellen O. Tauscher, a former California congresswoman, and Caitlin Klevorick, who previously worked at the Clinton Foundation, launched activities in the private sector while working as special government employees at the State Department.::::::::Records show that Tauscher received a special designation in 2012 after serving as special envoy for strategic stability and missile defense in the office of the secretary of state.::::::::Tauscher said she served only a few months. During that time, she joined a corporate board. She later started work as a lawyer with a Washington firm.::::::::Tauscher, who has since been active in the Ready for Hillary Super PAC, said she received the designation after expressing interest in retiring from government. She was told that the State Department wanted her to continue to serve at least part time so she could remain involved with ongoing missile-defense negotiations with Russian officials.::::::::Klevorick, who joined the State Department as an aide to Clinton, received two one-year special appointments beginning in January 2012. During that time, records show that Klevorick established CBK Strategies, a consulting firm that advises government and corporate clients on communications and policy.::::::::Klevorick, whose participation in the program was first reported last year by Pro Publica, did not respond to requests for comment. Gerlach said Klevorick served as a senior adviser to the department.::::::::Rosner, a pollster who worked for the National Security Council during Bill Clinton’s administration, had a special government employee assignment in 2011, a period during which he continued his association with the Washington-based political consulting firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner.

"32370"	"2015-03-10"	"Fact check: What Obama knew about Clinton's e-mails"	"President Obama said he first learned ""through news reports"" that Hillary Clinton used a private e-mail system when she was his secretary of State. But it turns out he did know she used a private e-mail address, at least for some official business. The White House now says the two leaders traded e-mails and ""the president was aware of her e-mail address.""::::::::Clinton has come under criticism after The New York Times reported on March 2 that she exclusively used a private e-mail account (registered to clintonemail.com) to conduct government business while secretary of State from January 2009 to February 2013. At the request of the State Department, Clinton two months ago turned over 55,000 pages of e-mails that involved government business, the Times reported.::::::::Obama was asked about Clinton's e-mails during an interview with CBS News correspondent Bill Plante on March 7.::::::::Plante, March 7: Mr. President, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an e-mail system outside the U.S. government for official business while she was secretary of state?::::::::Obama: The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.::::::::Obama's answer to Plante begged the question of whether the president e-mailed Clinton and, if so, how did he not know Clinton was using a private account? Two days after the president's interview aired on CBS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest clarified that the two leaders, obviously, did exchange e-mails and he knew her e-mail address.::::::::Earnest, who made his remarks at about 44:45 into his press briefing, said the president didn't know that she had a personal e-mail server and did not have a government account.::::::::Earnest, March 9: [T]he president was referring specifically to the arrangement associated with Secretary Clinton's e-mail. Yes, the president was aware of her e-mail address. He traded e-mails with her. That shouldn't be a surprise that the president of the United States is going to trade e-mails with the secretary of State. But the president was not aware of the fact that this was a personal e-mail server and that this was the e-mail address that she was using exclusively for all her business. The president was not aware of that until that had been more widely reported.::::::::The existence of Clinton's private e-mail account actually has been publicly known since March 2013, when the Smoking Gun wrote several stories about a hacker who broke into the AOL account of former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal. Smoking Gun showed screen grabs of e-mails Blumenthal had sent to Clinton's private e-mail account, hdr22@clintonemail.com, when she was secretary of State. ""Blumenthal's memos and e-mails to Clinton were sent to her at a non-governmental e-mail address through the web domain 'clintonemail.com,' "" Smoking Gun reported on March 18, 2013.::::::::As Politico explained at the time: ""The hacker had apparently sorted the mail to list (and possibly download) the Word files attached to these specific emails, which include foreign policy and intelligence memos that were sent to Clinton when she served as Secretary of State.""::::::::That's why State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf dismissed the latest controversy over Clinton's e-mail as ""not news.""::::::::""I would also point out that the notion that she had this e-mail account is certainly not news; it's been reported on for more than two years at this point,"" Harf said at a briefing on March 3 in response to the Times story. ""So I was a little surprised — although maybe I shouldn't have been — by some of the breathless reporting coming out last night, but I guess that's the nature of where we are today.""::::::::Marcel Lehel Lazar of Romania, who hacked into Blumenthal's AOL account, was widely known as ""Guccifer"" and received more publicity for hacking into the personal e-mail accounts of people more famous than a former Clinton aide. He also hacked into the account of a family member of George W. Bush to reveal the former president's self portraits. In June, he was sentenced to four years in jail in Romania. A week later, he was indicted on charges of ""wire fraud, unauthorized access to a protected computer, aggravated identity theft, cyberstalking and obstruction of justice,"" according to a Justice Department press release.::::::::Justice Department, June 12, 2014: According to the indictment, from December 2012 to January 2014, Lazar hacked into the email and social media accounts of high-profile victims, including a family member of two former U.S. presidents, a former U.S. Cabinet member, a former member of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former presidential advisor.::::::::We asked the White House whether the president was referring to the March 2013 or March 2015 media reports when he told CBS that he learned about Clinton's e-mail account ""[t]he same time everybody else learned it through news reports."" The White House, however, declined further comment."

Republicans have continued to question her transparency and ethics while some Democrats have also called for more disclosure.::::::::Democrats on Tuesday urged Clinton to offer a public explanation about her use of the private email account, first reported by The New York Times last week, including the use of her own private computer server.::::::::""She should come forward and explain the situation,"" Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Republican-controlled Senate, told MSNBC.::::::::""I'd like to hear her explanation of why she did it and what was covered by it,"" he said in an interview. ""I think it's only fair to say to Hillary Clinton: 'Tell us your side of the story.'""::::::::The controversy has complicated Clinton's plans for the launch of her campaign, which is expected in the next few weeks. State Department officials say it will take several months to review Clinton's email for release.::::::::Clinton, who left the State Department in 2013, provided copies of what her office said were all work-related emails from her tenure in a response to a request by the agency last year, some 55,000 pages in all.::::::::The emails were hosted on a private server registered to Clinton's home rather than a government system.::::::::Obama said on Saturday that he only recently had learned through news reports that Clinton used private email. His spokesman, Josh Earnest, later clarified that Obama knew Clinton's email address because they wrote to each other, but he was not aware of how it was set up or was kept in compliance with records laws.::::::::Clinton's team said previous secretaries of state either did not use email or used personal addresses. Current Secretary of State John Kerry is the first to regularly use only a department email address, according to the State Department.::::::::Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have received copies of some of Clinton's emails from the State Department for a continuing probe of the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.::::::::The Republican members have complained they have no way of knowing if there are other related emails that Clinton has not provided and have issued subpoenas seeking more records.::::::::They believe Clinton's emails will shed light on whether she did enough to protect U.S. officials in Libya."
"32394"	"2015-03-10"	"Obama on Clinton emails, IRS, VA, Fast and Furious: I heard about it on the news"	"The most powerful man in the world sure seems to get a lot of information about what's going on inside his administration from outside news reports.::::::::The latest example was President Obama saying in an interview aired over the weekend that he learned of his former secretary of state's personal email use from the media.::::::::Asked when he first found out Hillary Clinton was using a non-official system to conduct government business, Obama told CBS News: ""The same time as everybody else, through news reports.""::::::::It wasn't quite that simple, as the White House soon clarified. Press Secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged Monday that Obama and Clinton did exchange emails.::::::::""The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office, trade emails with the secretary of state,"" he said.::::::::Presumably, that means the president would have noticed Clinton was not using a "".gov"" account. But Earnest said Obama nevertheless was unaware of Clinton's personal email server and how she was following federal records law.::::::::This, of course, is hardly the first time Obama has claimed he was in the dark about a scandal in his administration until it surfaced in the news.::::::::Here's a look back at other news flashes delivered to the White House on his watch.::::::::When news reports broke that dozens of veterans died while waiting for care at a Phoenix VA facility, then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked about the claims at a May 19, 2014, briefing.  ""I believe we learned about them through the reports. I will double-check if that's not the case. But that's when we learned about them, and that's when, as I understand, Secretary [Eric] Shinseki learned about them and immediately took the action that he has taken, including instigating his own review ... but also requesting that the inspector general investigate,"" Carney said.  Shinseki resigned several days later, and was replaced. Then-IRS senior official Lois Lerner admitted in May 2013 that her agency had conducted inappropriate targeting of conservative groups, by singling them out for additional -- often drawn-out -- scrutiny when applying for tax-exempt status.  Obama was asked about the revelation during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron.  ""I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,"" Obama said. ""I think it was on Friday. And this is pretty straightforward.""  The president was asked again about the issue during a press conference with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- specifically whether the White House knew about the IRS actions before April, when his counsel's office first learned of them.  ""I can assure you that I certainly did not know anything about the IG report before the IG report had been leaked through the press,"" Obama said, referring to a highly critical IG report that helped drive the IRS' public admission. ""Typically, the IG reports are not supposed to be widely distributed or shared."" Around the same time as the IRS controversy, it was revealed that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas for Associated Press phone records.  Asked on May 14, 2013, when Obama found out, Carney said: ""Yesterday. Let me just be clear. We don't have any independent knowledge of that. He found out about the news reports yesterday on the road.""::::::::   Obama was asked in a March 22, 2011, interview with CNN Espanol about the Fast and Furious scandal, where federal law enforcement officials allowed guns to be illegally trafficked across the Mexican border and tried to monitor them. The weapons later showed up at numerous crime scenes, including when border agent Brian Terry was killed in December 2010.  ""I heard on the news about this story that Fast and Furious, where allegedly guns were being run into Mexico and ATF knew about it but didn't apprehend those who had sent it. Eric Holder has -- the attorney general has been very clear that he knew nothing about this. We had assigned an IG, inspector general, to investigate it.""  Carney reiterated that point again at a press briefing in June 2012.  ""Everyone knows the president did not know about this tactic until he heard about it through the media; the attorney general did not know about it,"" he said. ""The tactic itself was employed by the previous administration in a different operation. This was a field office tactic that was flawed. And when the attorney general learned about it, he took action to ensure that it was no longer used, and he directed the inspector general at the Department of Justice to investigate."" Early on in the Obama administration, in April 2009, an Air Force One flyover was staged over New York City as part of a photo op and exercise. But local officials had not been notified, and, in a city still shaken by the 9/11 attacks, the flyover caused public panic.  Asked about it on April 28, Obama said: ""It was a mistake, as was -- as was stated. It was something we found out about along with all of you and it will not happen again."""
"32420"	"2015-03-10"	"Hillary Clinton: I used one email 'for convenience'"	"Clinton said she used a private domain for her official work during her time at the State Department out of ""convenience,"" but admitted in retrospect ""it would have been better"" to use multiple emails.::::::::""I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two,"" she said. ""Looking back, it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.""::::::::READ: Did she do anything wrong or not?::::::::The former secretary of state defended her process in choosing which emails to turn over to the State Department, telling reporters that she and her staff ""err[ed] on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work-related.""::::::::""I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters and I feel like I've taken unprecedented steps for these emails to be in the public domain,"" Clinton said. ""I went above and beyond what I was requested to do.""::::::::But that reassurance will likely fall short for critics who point out there's no way of verifying her team turned over all government-related emails no matter how politically damaging they may be.::::::::In a 20-minute press conference, Clinton answered an array of questions raised by the revelation that she exclusively used a private server and domain for her official business during her time at state.::::::::She said that the 55,000 pages of correspondence she turned over to the State Department for review made up about half, or 30,000, of the overall 60,000 emails she sent and received with the private server.::::::::The other 30,000 — which included everything from wedding planning to yoga routines, Clinton said — she deleted.::::::::She also said she didn't use the server to send any classified information, but asserted that there were no security breaches on the server anyway. It was housed, Clinton told reporters, on private property, guarded by Secret Service and had been set up for President Bill Clinton's use.::::::::The press conference was an unexpected and unwanted end to a day Clinton allies had hoped would be focused on her work advocating for women's rights globally, with a speech at the United Nations' Women's Empowerment Principles event. Clinton used the speech to discuss her ""No Ceilings"" report on the conditions for women and girls globally and propose solutions for the challenges to promoting women's rights, which she called the ""unfinished business"" of the century.::::::::""Let's all keep working until we can say the unfinished business of the 21st century is completed,"" Clinton said during the speech.::::::::But with the controversy surrounding her use of a personal email server and domain during her time at State continuing into its second week, Clinton had to follow the speech at the U.N. with a hastily arranged a press conference.::::::::It was her first large engagement with reporters in five months, since she gaggled with the press during a political event in Iowa last September. Around 25 cameras were trained on the Democrat as she answered questions from behind a podium, and press from as far as Turkey were in New York to cover the event.::::::::Media attention around Tuesday's event was more heightened than usual, but the focus appeared to be on emails.::::::::Outside the event early on, reporters lined up to shout questions at both Hillary and Bill Clinton in vain. Neither responded to repeated questions about the email controversy.::::::::The State Department did offer details on how the emails would be released prior to Clinton's press conference. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said after the review of the 55,000 pages of documents — which would take months — they would be posted on a publicly accessible website. The 300 emails pertaining to the request made by the congressional committee investigating the attacks in Benghazi, amounting to about 900 pages, will be released first.::::::::Psaki said the review wouldn't cost taxpayers anymore than a review of emails sent entirely through an official State Department email would, as both are done with hard-copy printouts.::::::::While Clinton allies are breathing a sigh of relief that she's finally decided to break the silence, the past three weeks of controversies, which began with scrutiny of her family foundation's donors last month, has taken its toll.::::::::Though few Democrats other than Clinton are readying a potential campaign, Democratic critics already wary of her expected presidential candidacy found further evidence Clinton needs to face a credible primary challenge to prepare for the general election.::::::::The controversy has even strained relations with the Obama administration, which has been forced to answer for her use of a private email server as she's remained silent on the issue.::::::::With a more formal campaign launch expected as soon as next month, Clinton's Tuesday has been transformed from a victory lap to a high-stakes dance with the press."
"32435"	"2015-03-10"	"Hillary Clinton's office releases Q&A on e-mails"	"Hillary Rodham Clinton's office released a Q&A after her Tuesday news conference about the use of her personal e-mail account while serving as secretary of State, stating, ""We wanted to take this opportunity, given how much information has been circulating, to provide the best information we have about an understandably confusing situation.""::::::::The statement and Q&A are embedded, and transcribed, below.::::::::Statement from the office of Hillary Rodham Clinton:::::::::Like Secretaries of State before her, Secretary Clinton used her own email account when engaging with State Department officials. For work, it was her practice to email them on their "".gov"" accounts, with every expectation those emails would be captured and preserved immediately in the Department's system.::::::::When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring that their work emails were in fact retained, she said yes and provided printed copies of all of her work-related emails. She has since asked the Department to make the emails she provided available to the public.::::::::She is proud of the work that she and the public servants at the Department did during her four years as Secretary of State and looks forward to people being able to see that for themselves.::::::::Why did she use her own email account?::::::::As the Secretary has said publicly, when she got to the Department, she wanted the simplicity of using one device. She opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience; it enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule. That is the only reason she used her own account. Her usage was widely known to the over 100 Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed, as her address was visible on every email she sent. To address requirements to keep records of her work emails, it was her practice to email government officials on their "".gov"" accounts. That way, they would be immediately captured and preserved in the Department's system.::::::::Yes. The laws and regulations allowed her to use her own email for work.::::::::Under the Federal Records Act, reaffirming a prior regulation (36 CFR § 1234.24) on the need to preserve work emails.::::::::In meeting the record-keeping obligations, it was Secretary Clinton's practice to email government officials on their "".gov"" accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured and preserved.::::::::Was she ever provided guidance about her use of a non-"".gov"" email account?::::::::The Department has and did provide guidance regarding the need to preserve federal records, which included her work emails. To address requirements to keep records of her work emails, it was her practice to email government employees on their "".gov"" email address. That way, work emails would be immediately captured and preserved in government record-keeping systems.::::::::What did Secretary Clinton provide to the Department?::::::::On December 5, 2014, 30,490 printed copies of work-related emails sent and received by Secretary Clinton from March 18, 2009 to February 1, 2013 were provided to the Department. This totaled roughly 55,000 pages. About 90% of these emails were already in the Department's record-keeping system because they were sent to or received by ""state.gov"" accounts::::::::[Before March 18, 2009, Secretary Clinton continued using the email account she had used during her Senate service. Given her practice from the beginning of emailing Department officials on their state.gov accounts, her work-related emails during these initial weeks would have been captured and preserved in the Department's record-keeping system. She, however, no longer had access to these emails once she transitioned from this account.]::::::::Why did the Select Committee announce that she used multiple email addresses during her tenure?::::::::In fairness to the Committee, this was an honest misunderstanding. Secretary Clinton used one email account during her tenure at State (with the exception of her first weeks in office while transitioning from an email account she had previously used). In March 2013, a month after she left the Department, Gawker published the email address she used while Secretary, and so she had to change the address on her account.::::::::At the time the printed copies were provided to the Department last year, because it was the same account, the new email address established after she left office appeared on the printed copies as the sender, and not the address she used as Secretary. In fact, this address on the account did not exist until March 2013. This led to understandable confusion that was cleared up directly with the Committee after its press conference.::::::::Why did the Department ask for assistance? Why did the Department need assistance in further meeting its requirements under the Federal Records Act?::::::::The Department formally requested the assistance of the four previous former Secretaries in a letter to their representatives dated October 28, 2014 to help in furtherance of meeting the Department's requirements under the Federal Records Act.::::::::The letter stated that in September 2013, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued new guidance clarifying records management responsibilities regarding the use of personal email accounts for government business.::::::::While this guidance was issued after all four former Secretaries had departed office, the Department decided to ensure its records were as complete as possible and sought copies of work emails sent or received by the Secretaries on their own accounts.::::::::Why was the Department given printed copies?::::::::That is the requirement. The instructions regarding electronic mail in the Foreign Affairs Manual require that ""until technology allowing archival capabilities for long-term electronic storage and retrieval of E-mail messages is available and installed, those messages warranting preservation as records (for periods longer than current E-mail systems routinely maintain them) must be printed out and filed with related records."" [5 FAM 443.3].::::::::Were any work items deleted in the course of producing the printed copies?::::::::How many emails were in her account? And how many of those were provided to the Department?::::::::Her email account contained a total of 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. Based on the review process described below, 30,490 of these emails were provided to the Department, and the remaining 31,830 were private, personal records.::::::::How and who decided what should be printed and provided to the Department?::::::::The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].::::::::Following conversations with Department officials and in response to the Department's October 28, 2014 letter to former Secretaries requesting assistance in meeting the Department's record-keeping requirements, Secretary Clinton directed her attorneys to assist by identifying and preserving all emails that could potentially be federal records. This entailed a multi-step process to provide printed copies of the Secretary's work-related emails to the Department, erring on the side of including anything that might potentially be a federal record. As the State Department has said, Secretary Clinton was the first to respond to this letter.::::::::A search was conducted on Secretary Clinton's email account for all emails sent and received from 2009 to her last day in office, February 1, 2013.::::::::After this universe was determined, a search was conducted for a "".gov"" (not just state.gov) in any address field in an email. This produced over 27,500 emails, representing more than 90% of the 30,490 printed copies that were provided to the Department.::::::::To help identify any potential non-"".gov ""correspondence that should be included, a search of first and last names of more than 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials was performed. This included all Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors-at-Large, Special Representatives and Envoys, members of the Secretary's Foreign Policy Advisory Board, and other senior officials to the Secretary, including close aides and staff.::::::::Next, to account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies, the emails were sorted and reviewed both by sender and recipient.::::::::Lastly, a number of terms were specifically searched for, including: ""Benghazi"" and ""Libya.""::::::::These additional three steps yielded just over another 2,900 emails, including emails from former Administration officials and long-time friends that may not be deemed by the Department to be federal records. And hundreds of these emails actually had already been forwarded onto the state.gov system and captured in real- time.::::::::With respect to materials that the Select Committee has requested, the Department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the Department to the Select Committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.::::::::Given Secretary Clinton's practice of emailing Department officials on their state.gov addresses, the Department already had, and had already provided, the Select Committee with emails from Secretary Clinton in August 2014 — prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails.::::::::The review process described above confirmed Secretary Clinton's practice of emailing Department officials on their .gov address, with the vast majority of the printed copies of work-related emails Secretary Clinton provided to the Department simply duplicating what was already captured in the Department's record-keeping system in real time.::::::::When the emails provided to the Department are made available, what is an example of what we will see?::::::::You will see everything from the work of government, to emails with State and other Administration colleagues, to LinkedIn invites, to talk about the weather -- essentially what anyone would see in their own email account.::::::::Did Secretary Clinton use this account to communicate with foreign officials?::::::::During her time at State, she communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone. The review of all of her emails revealed only one email with a foreign (UK) official.::::::::Do you think a third party should be allowed to review what was turned over to the Department, as well as the remainder that was not?::::::::The Federal Records Act puts the obligation on the government official, not the agency or a third party, to determine what is and is not a federal record. The State Department Foreign Affairs Manual outlines guidance ""designed to help employees determine which of their e-mail messages must be preserved as federal records and which may be deleted without further authorization because they are not Federal record materials."" [5 FAM 443.1(c)].::::::::Secretary Clinton responded to the Department's request by providing approximately 55,000 pages of her work-related emails. She has also taken the unprecedented step of asking that those emails be made public. In doing so, she has sought to support the Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record- keeping and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the Department did during her tenure.::::::::After her work-related emails were identified and preserved, Secretary Clinton chose not to keep her private, personal emails that were not federal records. These were private, personal messages, including emails about her daughter's wedding plans, her mother's funeral services, and condolence notes, as well as emails on family vacations, yoga routines, and other items one would typically find in their own email account, such as offers from retailers, spam, etc.::::::::Government officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work related emails, including personal emails on .gov accounts. Secretary Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work related emails.::::::::Can't she release the emails she provided to the Department herself?::::::::Because the printed copies of work-related emails she provided to the Department include federal records of the Department, the Department needs to review these emails before they can be made public. She wants them to be made available as soon as possible.::::::::Was classified material sent or received by Secretary Clinton on this email address?::::::::No. A separate, closed system was used by the Department for the sole purpose of handling classified communications which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system, including to outside email accounts.::::::::How did Secretary Clinton receive and consume classified information?::::::::The Secretary's office is located in a secure area. Classified information was viewed in hard copy by the Secretary while in the office. While on travel, the Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types.::::::::Where was the server for her email located?::::::::The server for her email was physically located on her property, which is protected by U.S. Secret Service.::::::::What level of encryption was employed? Who was the service provider, etc?::::::::The security and integrity of her family's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton's team. While the curiosity in the specifics of this set up is understandable, given what people with ill-intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices. However, suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.::::::::Was the server ever hacked?::::::::No, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.::::::::Was there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it?::::::::What was done after her email was exposed in February 2013 after the hacker known as ""Guccifer"" hacked Sid Blumenthal's account?::::::::While this was not a breach of Secretary Clinton's account, because her email address was exposed, steps were taken at that time to ensure the security and integrity of her electronic communications.::::::::Was the Department able to respond to requests related to FOIA or Congressional requests before they received printed copies of her work-related emails?::::::::Yes. As the Select Committee has said, the Department provided the Committee with relevant emails it already had on the state.gov system before the Department requested any printed copies from former Secretaries, and four months before the Department received the printed copies.::::::::For example, in the well-publicized hack of Sid Blumenthal's email account, a note he sent Secretary Clinton on September 12, 2012 was posted online. At first blush, one might not think this exchange would be captured on the state.gov system. But in fact, Secretary Clinton forwarded the email, that very same day, onto the state.gov system. And the email was produced by the Department to the Select Committee, and acknowledged by the Select Committee, in August 2014.::::::::This example illustrates: 1) when an email from a non-"".gov"" sender had some connection to work or might add to the understanding of Department officials, it was Secretary Clinton's practice to forward it to officials at their ""state.gov"" address; and 2) the Department was able to search and produce Secretary Clinton's emails when needed long before, and unrelated to, receiving the printed copies as they were already captured on state.gov accounts.::::::::When will the emails be released to the public?::::::::Secretary Clinton has asked the Department to make her emails available as soon as possible. She is proud of the work that she and the public servants at the Department did during her four years as Secretary of State and is looking forward to people having the chance to see that for themselves.::::::::Transcript of Hillary Clinton's statement, released by her office:::::::::All set. Good afternoon. I want to thank the United Nations for hosting today's events and putting the challenge of gender equality front and center on the international agenda.::::::::I'm especially pleased to have so many leaders here from the private sector, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with advocates who've worked tirelessly for equality for decades. Twenty years ago, this was a lonelier struggle. Today, we marked the progress that has been made in the two decades since the international community gathered in Beijing and declared with one voice that, ""Human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights.""::::::::And because of advances in health, education, and legal protections, we can say that there has never been a better time in history to be born female. Yet as the comprehensive new report published by the Clinton Foundation and the Gates Foundation this week makes clear, despite all this progress, when it comes to the full participation of women and girls, we're just not there yet.::::::::As I said today, this remains the great unfinished business of the 21st century. And my passion for this fight burns as brightly today as it did twenty years ago. I want to comment on a matter in the news today regarding Iran. The President and his team are in the midst of intense negotiations. Their goal is a diplomatic solution that would close off Iran's pathways to a nuclear bomb and give us unprecedented access and insight into Iran's nuclear program. Now reasonable people can disagree about what exactly it will take to accomplish this objective, and we all must judge any final agreement on its merits.::::::::But, the recent letter from Republican senators was out of step with the best traditions of American leadership. And one has to ask: what was the purpose of this letter? There appear to be two logical answers -- either these Senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians, or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer does discredit to the letter's signatories.::::::::Now, I would be pleased to talk more about this important matter, but I know there have been questions about my emails, so I want to address that directly and then I will take a few questions from you. There are four things I want the public to know. First, when I got to work as Secretary of State, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account–which was allowed by the state department– because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails, instead of two. Looking back, it would have been better if I had simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue. Second, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department. Third, after I left office the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work-related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totaled roughly 55,000 printed pages. Even though I knew the state department had the vast majority of them.::::::::We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private, personal emails. Emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements. Condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations: the other things you typically find in in- boxes. No one wants their personal emails made public. And I think most people understand that and respect that privacy. Fourth, I took the unprecedented step of asking that the State Department make all my work-related emails public for everyone to see. I am very proud of the work that I, my colleagues, and our public servants at the Department did during my four years as Secretary of State. And I look forward to people being able to see that for themselves. Again, looking back, it would have been better for me to use two separate phones and two email accounts.::::::::I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn't worked out that way. And Now, I am happy to take a few questions."
"32444"	"2015-03-10"	"Key questions remaining about Hillary Clinton's e-mails"	"Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she complied with the law regarding her use of a private e-mail system while secretary of State, even while conceding it may have been better for her to use a government account for public business.::::::::While she answered questions about her e-mails, some key points will continue to be scrutinized:::::::::“There were no security breaches,” Clinton said. She explained that the server used to house her private e-mail was set up for use by former president Bill Clinton’s office with “numerous safeguards” and located on property protected by the Secret Service. But Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said after Clinton’s news conference that “serious questions” remain about the security of the e-mail system and who had access to the server since Clinton left the State Department in February 2013.::::::::Clinton received a letter dated Oct. 28, 2014 from the State Department asking four former secretaries of State to provide work-related emails that might be on a personal account — as directed by the Federal Records Act. She said she directed her counsel to “err on the side of providing anything that could be connected to work.” Clinton was the first to respond to the request, she said in a memo sent to reporters by her office after the news conference.::::::::Clinton gave the State Department her work-related e-mails in December, according to a Washington Post timeline. State sent the House Select Committee on Benghazi e-mails it had requested regarding the 2012 deadly attack on the U.S. compound in Libya in February.  Gowdy said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that there are “huge gaps” in e-mails provided to his committee, adding he has received some 800 pages.::::::::Clinton’s office said there were 62,320 e-mails that were sent and received from March 2009 to February 2013. Clinton described half as being “work related.” A total of 30,490 e-mails —printed out as required in the Foreign Affairs Manual — were sent to the State Department, her office said. Those e-mails represent 55,000 printed pages to State. The remaining 31,830 e-mails were personal.::::::::Clinton’s office said a search was conducted for any .gov e-mail address, which produced over 27,500 e-mails (or more than 90% of the printed copies given to State). Then a search was conducted for what was described as “non-obvious or non-recognizable” e-mail addresses, including misspellings. Finally, a search was conducted for specific terms, including “Benghazi” and “Libya.”::::::::What about the Republican call for an independent arbiter to review her e-mails?::::::::Clinton indicated she would not agree to such a step. “I went above and beyond what I was requested to do,” she said, adding that she has taken “unprecedented steps.” Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus criticized Clinton’s response. “No one but Hillary Clinton knows if she handed over every relevant e-mail,” he said after the news conference.::::::::We can only go by what Clinton says. She said she “didn’t see any reason” to keep private communications such as those to her husband and family. Ultimately, Clinton said, every federal employee who uses multiple devices and e-mail accounts has to make the decision between private and public communications. “We trust and count on the judgment of thousands, maybe millions of people to make those decisions,” she said.::::::::Clinton did not answer direct questions about her future political plans. But she wouldn’t have endured such questioning Tuesday if she didn’t have a White House bid in mind. “I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters,” she said, seeming to welcome a public review of her e-mails once they are released by the State Department. “I look forward to having a discussion about that.”"
"32456"	"2015-03-10"	"A Defiant, Feisty Clinton Brushes Off E-Mail Controversy"	"What emerged most clearly from her press conference on Tuesday when she addressed the controversy over her use of e-mail as secretary of state is that the Hillary Clinton that runs in 2016 won't be that different from the woman who was first lady in the 1990's and a presidential candidate eight years ago.::::::::In her press conference, like much of her more than 20 years on the public stage, she was confident not only in the rightness of her position (""I fully complied with every rule that I was governed by,"") but that the American public, if not the press, would agree with her. (""I feel like once the American public begins to see the e-mails, they will have an unprecedented insight into a high government official's daily communications, which I think will be quite interesting."" )::::::::She was a tad contrite (""looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account""), but like when she was first lady and a candidate, unwilling to concede much to her critics. She at times used slippery, legalistic language, emphasizing her successor John Kerry was the first secretary of state to ""primarily"" use a government e-mail - a fact that obscures that only four people have held that post since e-mail has been widely used and one them (Condoleezza Rice) sent very few e-mails but all on government servers.::::::::Clinton is known to believe that the press focuses on silly issues instead of important ones. She made that point subtly in her remarks on Tuesday, talking about the work on gender equality she was doing at the United Nations and then blasting congressional Republicans for trying to undermine President Obama's negotiations with Iran before turning to the e-mail issue. She repeatedly invoked the American public as her audience, making clear she was addressing questions they might have, not the political press, of which Clinton is deeply skeptical.::::::::When a reporter asked Clinton if the controversy over her e-mail would have erupted if she were a man, the former first lady, whose supporters say she has long been the victim of sexism, smirked, even as she dodged the question.::::::::Early reaction to Clinton's remarks, unsurprisingly, was divided along on partisan lines. Elijah Cummings, a House Democrat and longtime Clinton ally, said, ""I am glad Secretary Clinton addressed this issue directly."" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus blasted Clinton as ""completely disingenuous.""::::::::""If she had an ounce of respect for the American people, she would have apologized for putting our national security at risk for 'convenience,"" he said. ""She would've agreed to hand over her secret server to an independent arbiter. And she would've reassured the nation that her influence is not for sale to foreign governments. She did none of that.""::::::::He added, ""Because only Hillary Clinton controls her personal email account and admitted she deleted many of her emails, no one but Hillary Clinton knows if she handed over every relevant email.""::::::::The performance was very Clintonian to those who have watched both Clinton and her husband.::::::::But it was a shift in one major way: Clinton was talking to the press at all.::::::::The heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination had been running essentially a Rose Garden-strategy for months, behaving as if she were an incumbent president running for reelection. Party donors flocked to her and prominent Democrats, including two of President Obama's top advisers, have signed on to aid her campaign, even as Clinton has refused to announce publicly that she is a candidate.::::::::But the dispute over her use of only a private e-mail account, instead of one on a government server, caused senior Democrats to urged Clinton to confront the issue publicly and directly. Her aides had hinted the controversy would pass and was simply a media obsession, but they bent to the will of key Democrats, including California senator and Clinton ally Dianne Feinstein, who said her silence was causing the issue to get bigger.::::::::A confident Clinton took numerous questions on the e-mail matter, speaking for more than 20 minutes.::::::::But Clinton could have stopped once she gave her initial statement, as she budged little under questioning, as is her style. Her message, no matter the question was the same: she had followed the law but should have had two separate e-mail accounts anyway, was taking the ""unprecedented"" step of releasing all of her work-related emails to the State Department and she would leave it to the public to determine if she was wrong to not release her more personal notes.::::::::""No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,"" Clinton said.::::::::Clinton could be so confident because the e-mail controversy, at least for now, is having little impact on her electoral prospects. Democrats remain firmly behind Clinton as the party's choice to be its nominee in 2016. There are no signs that strong alternatives to Clinton, particularly Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are changing their minds and deciding to enter the race. And none of the Democratic elected officials, donors and campaign operatives who have already endorsed Clinton or joined her staff are backing away from her in light of these revelations.(A recent NBC/WSJ poll found a whopping 86 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they could see themselves supporting her.)::::::::Even former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, two of the Democrats who are running against Clinton, have avoided attacking her over the e-mail controversy.::::::::""The Draft Warren movement is less concerned with the frenzy surrounding Secretary Clinton's emails than we are with standing up, on behalf of millions of working families, to those who are rigging the system in favor of the rich and powerful,"" said Erica Sagrans, who is running a group that is urging Warren to run.::::::::And for the election in November 2016, factors as such the unemployment rate, President Obama's approval rating and ideology (most Americans lean either towards the GOP or the Democrats and vote accordingly in a presidential race) will affect Clinton much more than the e-mail dispute."
"32464"	"2015-03-10"	"Clinton's strategy on e-mail use: 'Trust me.' But how will voters respond?"	"Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton speaks to the media March 10 about recent allegations of an improperly used e-mail account during her tenure at the State Department. (Yana Paskova/Getty Images)::::::::Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to quash the controversy over her use of a personal e-mail account as secretary of state with a strategy that can be reduced to two words: “Trust me.” It is one of the biggest issues that will confront many Americans if and when she asks them to vote for her for president in 2016.::::::::The uproar over her e-mail account underscores several continuing questions about the former secretary. Does she have something to hide? Can she project openness and trustworthiness in an authentic way? Or have the conflicts of a quarter-century of political combat left her so defensive and wary about her opponents and the media that she will keep herself too shielded from the public?::::::::Clinton isn’t yet a candidate for president, and she brushed aside questions about whether the e-mail controversy would affect her timetable for making a decision on this issue. But with a campaign apparatus rapidly building strength, the answer to that question is hardly a secret. In that sense, the e-mail issue was not some leftover piece of business from her time in government but rather the first real test of her non-campaign campaign.::::::::Tuesday’s news conference offered a hint of what the future could be like — and it looked a lot like the past, with a controversy building until there was no other choice but to speak publicly about it and a media crush that no other candidate would attract. Some politicians faced with a similar problem have stood at a microphone until reporters exhausted all their questions. Clinton chose to cut off the questioning after only about 20 minutes.::::::::In many ways, Clinton managed to get through the news conference without sustaining any obvious additional damage, even if she did not fully satisfy everyone with her answers. She was not apologetic, but she did admit that it would have been smarter if she were to have found another way to segregate professional and personal e-mail communications. She would not say explicitly that what she did was a mistake.::::::::At the same time, she insisted that it was convenience and not a penchant for secrecy that drove that decision. She said she preferred one device — the BlackBerry captured in the now-iconic photo of her wearing dark glasses aboard her official airplane — rather than two devices, one for government work and one for e-mails about her daughter’s wedding, her mother’s funeral, yoga or all things people e-mail about with friends and family.::::::::That is a decision that many people make in their own lives, preferring some separation. But it is also one that many do not make, particularly those in sensitive government positions. So hers was both a plausible and questionable choice, and she is paying a price for it.::::::::Beyond that, however, Clinton asserted that she has more than fulfilled her obligations. She admitted to no transgression of federal guidelines — though even President Obama seemed to have been caught by surprise at the news of how she handled her e-mail traffic.::::::::She said she had never transmitted classified material across the private server that housed her e-mail account, a system she said had been set up for her husband, former president Bill Clinton. She said multiple times that she had more than fully complied with what had been asked of her. “I went above and beyond what I was requested to do,” she said.::::::::What she said she did, upon being asked by the State Department last year to provide her electronic communications, was to order a thorough search of the roughly 60,000 e-mails from her tenure in office. Half of them, she and her team concluded, were work-related. She said they were turned over to the government and will eventually be made available on a public site.::::::::The remaining e-mails were judged by her and her team to be personal. They were deleted and presumably are now out of reach to investigators on the House Select Committee on Benghazi or anyone else. It is a sign of the distrust that Clinton must have for those she believes want to do her harm, a reflection of instincts built up over years and many scandals surrounding the Clintons — real or not.::::::::The decision to delete those messages is one that will no doubt give her opponents further cause to question whether she is being as transparent as she claims. She insisted that she followed normal protocols. All government officials, she said, are asked to make the decision about what is personal and what is work-related in their communications.::::::::She threw herself on the mercy of the public. “I trust the American people,” she said at one point. At another, she said, “People will have to judge for themselves.”::::::::For the loyalists around her and those eager to see her in the Oval Office, Tuesday’s news conference was welcome, if only because she had let the fire burn for days. Her explanations will now arm them to dismiss those who ask for more or question whether she was truly forthcoming.::::::::David Brock, the onetime Clinton antagonist who is a founder of the organization Correct the Record that was set up to defend her, said she has been as transparent as she is required to be. “Every American has a right to communicate privately with his or her own family,” he said. “There shouldn’t be a double standard for the secretary just because her last name is Clinton.”::::::::For her opponents, the instant response was a thumbs down. Carly Fiorina, the former tech CEO and now a prospective Republican presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of attacking Clinton on the campaign trail, noted Clinton’s request for trust. “Nothing in her track record suggests we should do so,” she said in a tweet.::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the Benghazi committee, issued a statement saying, “Regrettably, we are left with more questions than answers” from Clinton’s news conference. He noted that, without access to the server for her account, “there is no way to accept State’s or Secretary Clinton’s certification she has turned over all documents that rightfully belong to the American people.”::::::::So the controversy simmers on, with each side now even more dug in than before Clinton’s press conference. In the middle are those Americans still months and months away from knowing what they will do in November 2016. Clinton asks for their trust, but she will have to earn it over the course of the long campaign ahead."

But that statement – essentially telling Americans to trust her – may be hard for critics to swallow.::::::::Hate groups decline: Is the US less hateful or just less public?::::::::That was the basic message that came out of Hillary Rodham Clinton's press conference Tuesday afternoon at the United Nations, the first time – other than one brief tweet – that the former secretary of State has directly addressed concerns that she used a private e-mail account and server for her official work while she was in office.::::::::""Looking back, it would have been better if I had simply used a second e-mail account and carried a second phone"" for private correspondence, Mrs. Clinton said at the conference. But at the time, she said, ""I thought it would be easier to carry one device.""::::::::The press conference came a week after news about Clinton's private e-mail use broke, during which Clinton has been under increased pressure to answer questions about it. Even supporters, like Sen. Dianne Feinstein, (D) of California, were publicly encouraging her to speak, lest her silence prove too damaging.::::::::Clinton seemed to be trying to wait it out, as she has successfully done with other scandals, but the questions – and conspiracy theories from her opposition – continued to grow.::::::::On Tuesday, she emphasized repeatedly that she broke no rules. When she was in office, there was no prohibition on government officials using private e-mail accounts for official business (a policy that since has been updated). Other secretaries of State, including Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, also used personal e-mails for State Department business, though not as exclusively as Clinton did.::::::::She also discounted suggestions that the 55,000 pages of e-mails she provided to the State Department – which the Department has said it will be making public on a website once it has reviewed them – didn't include all her official e-mails.::::::::Clinton says that she had a thorough review done of her e-mails, and about half were work-related, while the other half ""were not in any way related to my work,"" and included things like correspondence about her daughter's wedding and condolence notes to friends. She said most of her work-related e-mails went to officials at their government email address, and so were automatically recorded. Her direction was to ""err on the side of providing anything that could possibly be viewed as work-related"" to the State Department, she said.::::::::But that statement – essentially telling the American public to trust her – may be hard for some of her critics to swallow.::::::::""If there’s one thing skeptics aren’t going to do it’s taking Hillary Clinton’s word for something,"" says Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College in California.::::::::Reporters pressed Clinton on whether she would release her server to an independent arbiter, which she categorically refused. ""No one wants their personal e-mails made public and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,"" she said.::::::::She also emphasized that the judgment on what is personal and what is public is ultimately a responsibility that rests with each government employee, not just her.::::::::""That is the responsibility of the individual, and I have fulfilled that responsibility, and I have no doubt we’ve done exactly what we should have done,"" Clinton said, repeatedly emphasizing that by asking the State Department to make her e-mails public, she has gone ""above and beyond"" what is required.::::::::Clinton is hardly the first government official to use private e-mail for official correspondence, but her doing so has gained particular attention because of how it was done – using a private server owned by the Clintons and not using her State Department e-mail address at all – and because it plays into a familiar criticism of the Clintons, that they resist transparency and play by their own rules.::::::::And then there's the primary reason for the furor: the fact that Clinton is the Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 presidential election. Both her supporters and her critics are watching closely to see how much harm ""E-mailgate"" will inflict on her, and also how well she handles the scrutiny, which is only likely to increase – for multiple issues – closer to the election. Her relationship with the press is notoriously hostile.::::::::""The real question for her now is not whether she can get this particular issue behind her, because I’m sure she can. It’s whether she can fundamentally change a toxic relationship with the political press that threatens her entire campaign,"" wrote Paul Waldman at The Washington Post's Plum Line blog.::::::::Clinton herself discounted the effect the e-mail revelation is likely to have on her presidential campaign. ""I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters and I feel like I've taken unprecedented steps for these emails to be in the public domain,"" she said.::::::::But some observers say that regardless of whether Clinton did anything wrong, the scandal hurts primarily because it plays into doubts Clinton's critics already have.::::::::""Ever since the 1990s, the Clintons' critics have been saying they’re too clever by half, they’re hiding things, and this press conference doesn’t go very far to allay those concerns,"" says Professor Pitney.::::::::How much it actually hurts her in the election depends in part on whether any further revelations come out, he adds. ""As it stands, it’s not fatal,"" Pitney says. ""If you’re talking to a guy that’s working two part-time jobs to put food on the table, Hillary Clinton's e-mails aren’t at the top of his concerns."""

Trey Gowdy, the committee chairman, told CNN on Tuesday.::::::::""We are going to seek any private email that relates to official business, and I don't care about wedding cakes, but any work that could have been done on private-to-private accounts for those State Department employees we know had private accounts,"" the South Carolina Republican said.::::::::A CNN request for comment from Clinton's press team was not immediately returned, nor did they provide an answer to whether or not any aides had private email accounts on her server.::::::::Gowdy said they want to see private emails as they relate to official business from people like Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff at the state department, longtime aide Huma Abedin, and Jake Sullivan, then-deputy chief of staff.::::::::""She said she she went through and produced all public information -- and I am not in the habit of accusing people of being untruthful unless I have evidence to the contrary -- but she's essentially asking us to take her word for it,"" said Gowdy.::::::::He said it is premature to say whether the committee will subpoena these former Clinton State Department aides to get the emails.::::::::SEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton donors frustrated by email controversy::::::::Gowdy said his select committee only has jurisdiction over emails regarding Libya.::::::::But he said there are gaps of time -- in which Clinton likely would have been emailing about Libya -- where the committee received no emails.::::::::For example they got no emails from her trip to Libya in October 2011, even though there is an iconic photo of her on a C17 with her Blackberry in her hand.::::::::""It wouldn't be reasonable that she was on her way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy and there are no emails from that trip,"" said Gowdy.::::::::Gowdy told CNN there are gaps in emails that Clinton gave the committee of ""several weeks, if not in some instances months.""::::::::He said that may be because she wasn't emailing about Libya during those gaps.::::::::Current State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said Monday that while she could not speak directly to a trip made under Clinton's tenure as secretary, it is not uncommon to cease emailing while overseas.::::::::""I obviously wasn¹t on that trip, but I¹ve been on many with [current Secretary of State John Kerry] where there are communications issues, where you really don't send emails given communications issues or given that the staff you need to ask questions of are right around you,"" Psaki said.::::::::Clinton's office issued a statement on Tuesday explaining how it searched through the secretary¹s private server for relevant emails to hand over to the State Department for archiving including searching for specific terms like ""Benghazi"" and ""Libya"".::::::::""With respect to materials that the select committee has requested, the department has stated that just under 300 emails related to Libya were provided by the department to the select committee in response to a November 2014 letter, which contained a broader request for materials than prior requests from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee,"" the statement said.::::::::""Given Secretary Clinton¹s practice of emailing department officials on their state.gov addresses, the separtment already had, and had already provided, the select committee with emails from Secretary Clinton in August 2014 -prior to requesting and receiving printed copies of her emails,"" it said."
"32484"	"2015-03-10"	"Clinton Tries to Quell Email Controversy"	"UNITED NATIONS — Hillary Rodham Clinton revealed on Tuesday that she had deleted about half her emails from her years as secretary of state, saying she had turned over to the Obama administration all correspondence about government business but had erased records of communications about private matters, like yoga routines, her daughter’s wedding and her mother’s funeral.::::::::In a news conference about her exclusive use of a private email account while secretary, Mrs. Clinton sought to squelch the furor about those communications, already in its second week. She acknowledged that it would have been wiser to use a government email for official business, but said she “fully complied with every rule,” and was going “above and beyond” what was required of her in asking the State Department to make public much of her email correspondence.::::::::“At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails,” Mrs. Clinton said. “No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.”::::::::She asked voters to trust that she was disclosing more of them than she needed to — and even to credit her with an unusual degree of transparency.::::::::Mrs. Clinton said she turned over some 30,490 emails to the State Department in December, nearly two years after leaving office. But she said she also deleted nearly 32,000 others.::::::::Her confirmation that she and her aides had chosen which emails to make available to the State Department raised new concerns about Mrs. Clinton’s power to decide which records of her tenure as secretary would be available to congressional investigators, to journalists filing Freedom of Information Act requests, and to history.::::::::It immediately emboldened Republicans who are leading a specially appointed House committee investigating the 2012 attack on a United States mission in Benghazi, Libya. “Because Secretary Clinton has created more questions than answers, the Select Committee is left with no choice but to call her to appear at least twice,” said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who is chairman of the committee.::::::::The news conference presented a rare and intriguing political spectacle: a former first lady and secretary of state, expected but not yet declared as a presidential candidate, standing inside the United Nations fielding pointed questions about secrecy, accountability and judgment.::::::::On Tuesday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s office announced that she would address the issue just after she delivered what was meant to be an attention-getting speech at the United Nations, part of a week of events intended to highlight Mrs. Clinton’s lifelong work to advance the rights of women and girls.::::::::Mrs. Clinton had hardly fielded questions from the political press since she last ran for president, in 2008. And the news conference had the feel of an unofficial — and ungainly — start to her 2016 presidential campaign, which could come formally as soon as early April.::::::::She said she had taken an “unprecedented” action in providing the State Department roughly 55,000 printed pages of emails, and pointed to other elected officials who use both official and private emails, deciding themselves which belongs on which account.::::::::“For any government employee, it is that government employee’s responsibility to determine what’s personal and what’s work related,” Mrs. Clinton told reporters. “I went above and beyond what I was requested to do.”::::::::Mrs. Clinton said she had only convenience in mind in choosing to use just a personal email account.::::::::“I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two,” she explained.::::::::“Looking back,” she said, “it might have been smarter to have those two devices from the very beginning.”::::::::Indeed, nothing prohibited federal employees from using private accounts for work when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, although the practice was discouraged. But, beginning in October 2009, 10 months after she took office, new regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration said that agencies where employees were free to use private email systems “must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.”::::::::In Mrs. Clinton’s case, her emails were backed up on her personal server — not on a government one. But she argued that, because she had sent emails to “government officials on their state or other .gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved,” she had complied with the rule. Mrs. Clinton did not address how emails she sent to people outside the government were preserved.::::::::“Once the American public begins to see the emails, they will have an unprecedented insight into a high government official’s daily communications,” she said.::::::::Mrs. Clinton said the server that housed her email address had been set up on property guarded by the Secret Service, and that there were no security breaches. She said she had never emailed classified material to anyone.::::::::It is unclear if the emails were deleted irretrievably, and a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to elaborate on how she had erased the correspondence.::::::::“If the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them, there’s a chance the emails could still be on the server’s hard drive if you forensically examine it,” said Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos. “To make sure the emails are really destroyed, you would have to physically destroy the hard drive, which many companies and places like the Defense Department often do.”::::::::Mr. Wisniewski said that if the emails were kept on a third-party provider, they were less likely to be recoverable.::::::::Mrs. Clinton’s explanation that it was more convenient to carry only one device seemed at odds with her remark last month, at a tech conference in Silicon Valley, that she uses multiple devices, including two kinds of iPads, an iPhone and a Blackberry. She said then: “I don’t throw anything away. I’m like two steps short of a hoarder.”::::::::At one point on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said the emails she deleted contained “personal communications from my husband and me.” But on Sunday, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton told reporters the former president had “sent two emails in his life.”::::::::After the news conference, Mrs. Clinton’s office provided several new details about the email account and what she has provided to the State Department. More than 100 government officials knew about Mrs. Clinton’s use of private email, her office said.::::::::Mrs. Clinton used her email only once to communicate with a foreign official, her office said.::::::::In 2007, Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, accused the George W.

It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.”::::::::She told reporters she would not turn over the server to be examined by congressional investigators or a neutral third party.::::::::Clinton last week had tweeted that she wanted the public to have access to her emails and asked the State Department to release them.::::::::She left the Obama administration in early 2013, but didn’t hand over her written communications for nearly two years and then only in response to a State Department request.::::::::In her first press conference in more than two years, Clinton clarified that the server she used contained more than 30,000 personal, non-work-related emails and that she had deleted them because felt she had a right to keep that correspondence private.::::::::As examples, she cited missives on her daughter Chelsea’s wedding, her mother’s funeral arrangements and yoga routines.::::::::“No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect their privacy,” Clinton said, arguing that she went “above and beyond” the government’s ask in providing emails.::::::::A sometimes defensive Clinton said she never sent classified materials over her personal email system.::::::::“I fully complied with every rule I was governed by,” she said.::::::::The email disclosures have raised questions about whether she fully complied with federal laws requiring government officials to preserve written communications involving official business.

Years earlier, when emailing was not the ubiquitous practice it is now among high officials, Colin Powell used both a government and a private account. It's a striking departure from the norm for top officials to rely exclusively on private email for official business.::::::::CLINTON: ""I fully complied with every rule I was governed by.""::::::::THE FACTS: At the very least, Clinton appears to have violated what the White House has called ""very specific guidance"" that officials should use government email to conduct business.::::::::Clinton provided no details about whether she had initially consulted with the department or other government officials before using the private email system. She did not answer several questions about whether she sought any clearances before she began relying exclusively on private emails for government business.::::::::Federal officials are allowed to communicate on private email and are generally allowed to conduct government business in those exchanges, but that ability is constrained, both by federal regulations and by their supervisors.::::::::Federal law during Clinton's tenure called for the archiving of such private email records when used for government work, but did not set out clear rules or punishments for violations until rules were tightened in November. In 2011, when Clinton was secretary, a cable from her office sent to all employees advised them to avoid conducting any official business on their private email accounts because of targeting by unspecified ""online adversaries.""::::::::CLINTON: ""I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.""::::::::THE FACTS: The assertion fits with the facts as known but skirts the issue of exchanging information in a private account that, while falling below the level of classified, is still sensitive.::::::::The State Department and other national security agencies have specified rules for the handling of such sensitive material, which could affect national security, diplomatic and privacy concerns, and may include material such as personnel, medical and law enforcement data. In reviewing the 30,000 emails she turned over to the State Department, officials are looking for any security lapses concerning sensitive but unclassified material that may have been disclosed.::::::::CLINTON: ""It had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.""::::::::THE FACTS: While Clinton's server was physically guarded by the Secret Service, she provided no evidence it hadn't been compromised by hackers or foreign adversaries. She also didn't detail who administered the email system, if it received appropriate software security updates, or if it was monitored routinely for unauthorized access.::::::::Clinton also didn't answer whether the homebrew computer system on her property had the same level of safeguards provided at professional data facilities, such as regulated temperatures, offsite backups, generators in case of power outages and fire-suppression systems. It was unclear what, if any, encryption software Clinton's server may have used to communicate with U.S. government email accounts.::::::::Recent high-profile breaches, including at Sony Pictures Entertainment, have raised scrutiny on how well corporations and private individuals protect their computer networks from attack.::::::::CLINTON: ""When I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. Looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.""::::::::THE FACTS: If multiple devices were an inconvenience in the past, they may be something of an obsession now. Clinton told an event in California's Silicon Valley last month that she has an iPad, a mini-iPad, an iPhone and a BlackBerry. ""I'm like two steps short of a hoarder,"" she said. She suggested she started out in Washington with a BlackBerry but her devices grew in number.::::::::Smartphones were capable of multiple emails when she became secretary; it's not clear whether the particular phone she used then was permitted to do so under State Department rules.::::::::Associated Press writer Calvin Woodward contributed to this report.::::::::EDITOR'S NOTE - An occasional look at claims by public officials that take shortcuts with the facts or don't tell the full story"
"32572"	"2015-03-11"	"Clinton trying to put emails to rest _ and prepare for 2016"	"Hillary Rodham Clinton answers questions at a news conference at the United Nations, Tuesday, March 10, 2015. Clinton conceded that she should have used a government email to conduct business as secretary of state, saying her decision was simply a matter of “convenience.” (Richard Drew/Associated Press)::::::::UNITED NATIONS — Trying to get the rollout of her presidential campaign back on track, Hillary Rodham Clinton says she should have used a government email address while working as the nation’s top diplomat — an admission that sought to quell a political furor some Democratic allies say she could no longer avoid.::::::::The focus on Clinton’s emails has jumbled what had been expected to be a smooth glide toward the kickoff of her presidential campaign next month. The former secretary of state had planned to spend March promoting her work on women’s equality, a signature issue for someone who could become the nation’s first female president.::::::::Instead, questions about Clinton’s email habits have dominated her activities in the past week, following revelations that she used a personal email account at the State Department and did so via a private server kept at her home in suburban New York.::::::::While Democrats have dismissed of the notion that Clinton’s emails are something voters will care about come Election Day 2016, her silence — aside from a late-night tweet sent last week — had led several of her former colleagues in the Senate to urge her to tell her side of the story.::::::::During a news conference Tuesday at the United Nations, after she had delivered a previously scheduled speech on women’s rights, Clinton pledged that all her work-related email would be made public “for everyone to see.” But she also acknowledged that she deleted messages related to personal matters. She refused calls from Republicans to turn over the email server she kept at her home to an independent reviewer.::::::::“The server contains personal communications from my husband and me, and I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private,” Clinton told reporters who crammed into a hallway to ask questions at her first news conference in more than two years.::::::::Some Democrats fretted that she had yet to put the issue to rest.::::::::“This is something that is going to be discussed until the State Department releases the emails,” said Boyd Brown, a Democratic National Committee member from South Carolina.::::::::“Then House Republicans will have a study committee to look at them, and then that will turn into an investigatory committee. Folks are going to be Clinton weary, and that’s the point of this from the Republican standpoint, to make people tired of hearing about Hillary Clinton,” Brown said.::::::::Not long after Clinton spoke, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., the chairman of a House panel investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, said he was “left with more questions than answers” and that he planned to call her to appear before his committee at least twice.::::::::Gowdy said one appearance from Clinton would be needed to “clear up” her role in using personal email, while the second would be to answer questions related to the Benghazi attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. Those appearances are likely to come after Clinton returns to politics as a presidential candidate, creating an unwelcome distraction for the leading contender for her party’s nomination.::::::::Clinton said Tuesday she had exchanged about 60,000 emails in her four years as President Barack Obama’s top diplomat, about half of which were work-related. None contained classified information, she said, and her private email system did not suffer any security breaches.::::::::But since the emails were sent to and from her personal server, there is no way to independently verify her assertion they were, as she said, “within the scope of my personal privacy and that particularly of other people.”::::::::Clinton insisted she did not break any rules, but she does appear to have violated what the Obama White House has called “very specific guidance” that officials should use government email to conduct business.::::::::Republicans also needled Clinton for her explanation that she used the private email account out of “convenience” — a way to avoid carrying one device for work emails and a second for personal messages. They pointed to Clinton’s appearance last month in California’s Silicon Valley, when an interviewer asked her if she preferred Apple’s iPhone or a phone running Google’s Android platform.::::::::“iPhone. OK, in full disclosure, and a BlackBerry,” Clinton said, adding: “I’m like two steps short of a hoarder. So I have an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone and a BlackBerry.”::::::::Democrats defended Clinton, saying it was reasonable to want to carry just one device. Jerry Crawford, a co-chair of her 2008 campaign in Iowa, called her response “a very commonsense explanation that Americans will appreciate.”::::::::“The only people I know who want to carry two devices are my kids,” Crawford said. “Ordinary folks get the hassle of that.”::::::::Still, Crawford and other Democrats appeared girded for a lengthy confrontation with Republicans over the issue. Clinton, meanwhile, brushed off suggestions that the email controversy might hurt a presidential campaign.::::::::“I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters,” she said.::::::::Follow Ken Thomas and Julie Pace on Twitter at http://twitter.com/KThomasDC and http://twitter.com/JPaceDC::::::::Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Clinton conceded Tuesday that she should have used a government email to conduct business as secretary of state, saying her decision was simply a matter of ""convenience."" (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) | ASSOCIATED PRESS::::::::Tuesday afternoon, the first act of ""Hillary Clinton Email Dämmerung"" concluded, with the former secretary of state providing an eager mass of reporters with a brief press conference, in which she ""Addressed The Controversy For The First Time"" and, as you might expect, ""Raised More Questions Than She Answered.""::::::::Behind her lectern in the United Nations' Turtle Bay redoubt, Clinton insisted that she went above and beyond the call of duty in terms of releasing her email, complied with all rules, and availed herself of every precautionary step to safeguard government work from the clutches of nefarious parties. She restated an already well-trafficked assurance, that the emails that pertained to State Department business went to other State Department email addresses, and thus are recoverable, archivable, and transparent.::::::::She explained her decision to use a personal email account for State Department business as a matter of convenience -- the desire to carry a single device instead of multiple ones, all of which served as a searing indictment of Blackberries, I guess, since most of the rest of the world has discovered that a single smartphone can contain multitudes of email accounts. As to whether the public should be assured that all of her email transactions were handled with the requisite responsibility, Clinton's response was to offer her own self-assessment that it was, and to point to pending releases of further email that, to her mind, would be sufficient to bear that out.::::::::Of all the decisions that led to these events, Clinton said, ""Obviously, it hasn't worked out."" Yes, well, I suppose not.::::::::If we decide not to overthink things, we can all admit that there is something that's beyond dispute. Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, is supposed to be subject to a certain level of oversight. While just about anyone sensible would admit that there are instances in which the head of our international diplomatic mission has to discuss matters that require secrecy, and that any top government official deserves some private space for frank criticism, private advice, and the opportunity to entertain controversial ideas, we are nevertheless entitled to the baseline assurance that what business can be conducted in the light of day is conducted in that matter, and that the actions of our elite officials will not be placed beyond scrutiny.::::::::But it's hard to not overthink this, because a certain amount of overthinking was there from the start. Obviously, the simplest thing for Clinton to have done would have been to open and maintain some sort of ""state.gov"" email account and conduct State Department business in that domain. Had she done so, there wouldn't be an issue. In fact, had she done so and simultaneously had a personal email account on the side, this still wouldn't be an issue, because most people would find the notion that Hillary Clinton is not allowed to have a private email account to be insane. But by commingling the two -- government and personal -- Clinton opened the door to this criticism, because we can't be sure by what rules Clinton follows to guide her decisions to archive or delete emails. Does she follow State Department guidelines, or her own whims?::::::::It is a thing that can't be known, and so, Hillary's email flap has become a problem that she can't solve, to anybody's satisfaction. This is true in the literal sense, because a lot of emails that were once in her ""possession"" have been deleted. But it's also true in a figurative sense. What is the ur-email she can provide, that once it is read, will assure everyone that full transparency has been achieved?::::::::At this point, it's worth wondering what sort of missives members of the teeming press corps believe that they can or should be entitled to find in Clinton's private stash. I promise you, nobody in the wide world is interested in reading emails pertaining to Clinton's rote, day-to-day State Department work, and the number of political reporters in Washington who are genuinely concerned with State Department transparency is too small to be of statistical significance.::::::::What people want to find is evidence of some buzzy internecine feud or conflict with the White House, some career-crippling statement of policy or opinion, some private message in which Clinton says something intemperate about a political opponent, or some tawdry act of State Department-Clinton Global Initiative synergy. (Of these, the last is the most vital to the American interest, but it would unfortunately end up in the hands of a media that lacks all interest in a substantial critique of how money and power now mesh to society's detriment, and it would be covered as a problem unique to Clinton rather than a pervasive problem in our political system.)::::::::Failing that, evidence of some embarrassing family problem, health issue, or lifestyle choice would be what the press would seek to uncover in a Clinton email cache. (Assuming, of course, that there aren't simply hundreds of extant emails with the subject line ""RE: BENGHAZI LOL."") But the salient point is this: Clinton's actions broadly suggest that she wanted to manage her emails in a way that guarded against a public humiliation, therefore nothing short of an email that publicly humiliates her will be sufficient to put this story to bed.::::::::Compounding the insolubility of the email flap itself is the fact that this is precisely the sort of story that Clinton can ill afford because it ""feeds an existing narrative"" about her, and her campaign. Actually, it feeds two existing narratives. As New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt explained on Morning Joe, days after he broke the story on Clinton's private email account, “There’ve been questions about the Clintons over the years, about their transparency and secrecy, and this feeds into narrative.” Secondarily, as Jonathan Chait notes, ""This revives the question of whether Clinton is capable of managing a competent campaign (and thus, in turn, a competent administration).""::::::::Normally, it's best to keep yourself far from any story in which someone is ""feeding"" or ""confirming"" some sort of ""narrative,"" if only because what the media calls a ""narrative"" is often miles and miles from the way normal human Americans actually think about politics. But in the Clintons' case, they keep adding their own ink to the story. Shortly after the email story broke, longtime Clinton adviser and anthropomorphic antithesis to the concept of congeniality Philippe Reines responded to a simple question from a Washington Free Beacon reporter by starting some sort of insane chain email with that reporter, a reporter from Gawker, Clinton's main spokesperson, and two media critics, on which he dyspeptically answered questions with more questions and generally displayed an aversion to grace and tact.::::::::Who does this? Why did this have to happen? It boggles the mind. The simple, uncluttered choice would have been to simply answer the original reporter's inquiry with a ""no comment"" and move on, instead of inviting some sort of numbskull public sideshow. Just as the simple, uncluttered choice would have been to have a State Department email, on which to conduct State Department business.::::::::It is, of course, an open question as to whether this will, in the end, mean anything at all. As New York Times' ace political scientist Brendan Nyhan notes:::::::::""All of this could change,"" Nyhan writes, ""if a true bombshell emerges from [Clinton's] famous Blackberry."" Indeed, the irony here is that if Clinton self-produces that bombshell, everyone will go home satisfied that she is being transparent. That's basically the only thing she can do at this point: torpedo her presidential campaign to save her reputation.::::::::That's why there is no universe in which opting out of using a State Department email was a smart thing to do, sorry.::::::::Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"

Clinton answered questions about recent allegations of an improperly used email account during her tenure as secretary of state. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images) | Yana Paskova via Getty Images::::::::The Clinton email controversy leads to more interaction and a more negative tone about her on Facebook, but are attitudes changing? Democrats sour on Netanyahu following his speech to Congress. And Americans prefer local government to Washington. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, March 11, 2015.::::::::CLINTON EMAIL STORY GENERATES FACEBOOK CHATTER - A Facebook analysis shows a ""huge, sustained spike in the number of Facebook interactions"" about Hillary Clinton since news broke about her use of a private email address while she served as Secretary of State that shows a ""gradual but marked downturn"" in tone. As reported by Buzzfeed's Katherine Miller, Facebook interactions about Clinton had ranged between 151,000 and 319,000, before the New York Times broke its first story about Clinton's use of private email. Interactions with Clinton posts immediately jumped to 1 million on March 3, peaking at 1.5 million on March 5 and declining gradually to 672,000 on March 7 (the graphics in the story initially had the March 7 figure as 672 million; Buzzfeed corrected the error on Wednesday morning). Facebook defines interaction in this instance as people commenting about Clinton on their accounts. [Buzzfeed]::::::::As volume increases, tone turns negative - More from Miller: ""The share of conversation about Clinton that was positive dipped from 57% during one period in the fall to 52% in January and then a 50% average in February. By Feb. 28, that sentiment [about Clinton] turned negative, and has stayed largely more negative than positive as conversations multiplied amid debate over her use of a personal email account. The sentiment data is drawn from a Facebook project that analyzes the language and symbols used by the massive social networks users....The sentiment data may not mirror polling data, though it has so far roughly tracked public polls. Her favorability rating has gradually declined, from peak over 60% in 2010, to below 50%, according to a recent New York Times average of public polls.""::::::::A measure of opinion, but not a poll - This episode highlights both the promise of Facebook data analysis and its challenge. The posting of stories and comments by millions of Americans, who can explicitly ""like"" what they see, allows for groundbreaking tracking of public opinion in real time. Yet the large spike in engagement means analysts should not track the data as they do opinion polls, which represent multiple measurements of the same population over time. In this case, the recent downturn of sentiment may reflect a change in the population interacting with posts about Clinton, with Republicans and conservatives increasingly activated. It will take standard polling to confirm whether attitudes about Clinton have changed, and not just those talking about her on Facebook.::::::::DEMOCRATS SOUR ON NETANYAHU - Jeffrey Jones: ""After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's much-publicized and controversial address to Congress, Americans' opinions of him have worsened. His [overall] favorable rating is down seven percentage points, to 38%, while his unfavorable rating has increased five points, to 29%. These changes are largely confined to Democrats; Republicans' views are essentially stable. The current rating, based on a March 5-8 poll, came just days after Netanyahu's March 3 address to Congress. Netanyahu's 45% pre-visit rating ranked among the highest Gallup has measured for him....The March 3 visit appears to have soured Americans' -- specifically Democrats' -- views of Netanyahu, though he remains more positively (38%) than negatively (29%) rated overall. Thirty-three percent of Americans do not have an opinion of Netanyahu, essentially unchanged from before the visit. Since February, Democrats have shifted from a 32% favorable/32% unfavorable opinion of Netanyahu to 17% favorable/46% unfavorable. The majority of Republicans, 62%, view the Israeli prime minister favorably."" [Gallup]::::::::AMERICANS PREFER LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DC - NJ Heartland Monitor Poll Nancy Cook: ""The most recent results of the 22nd Heartland Monitor poll, sponsored by Alllstate and National Journal...[show] the public favoring state and local institutions over the federal government as the places best equipped to offer solutions to the country's ongoing economic and social challenges. And federal government? Well, it just leaves people wanting more, according to the polling data. Of the 1,000 American adults surveyed, just 26 percent said that national-level institutions were making progress, compared to the 64 percent who favored the state and local levels. This conclusion cuts across the lines of gender, education, socioeconomics, and even different regions of the country. In short, Americans are fed up with the sniping and paralysis at the federal level and instead are turning their attention to local governments and groups for solutions."" [National Journal]::::::::FUNDAMENTALS EXPLAIN CONGRESSIONAL DYSFUNCTION - Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins: ""Immediately after Republicans gained control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, incoming majority leader Mitch McConnell pledged that 'there will be no government shutdowns' on his watch. Yet the newly unified Republican Congress took less than two months to force a standoff with the Obama administration over appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security… With Congress facing the exhaustion of the Highway Trust Fund in May, the need to raise the federal debt ceiling by the fall and the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30, more governing crises are possible, and maybe even probable... Republicans have been more ideologically unified and motivated than Democrats for at least 50 years. Given this foundational asymmetry, it is hardly surprising that the Republican Party is particularly susceptible to powerful internal movements pursuing greater ideological purity. The asymmetric nature of the parties is likely to shape the 2016 presidential nomination contests. As long as presumptive favorite Hillary Clinton retains strong support among the social groups that constitute the Democratic electoral base ...she has little reason to fear a serious intraparty challenge from the ideological left...The Republican presidential field, in contrast, will likely be dominated by multiple candidates who each claim the mantle of true conservatism.

"32643"	"2015-03-11"	"Hillary Clinton Defends E-mail Practices, and Draws a Line"	"Hillary Clinton offered detailed explanations Tuesday for the way she used a private e-mail account and server while she served as secretary of state, but her assertion that she had met all her obligations to release her correspondence failed to satisfy skeptical Republicans.::::::::In a hastily called press conference in a hallway at the United Nations, Clinton said she had turned over printed copies of thousands of work-related e-mails to the State Department but that she had gotten rid of thousands of other personal e-mails on the server. ""I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private,"" she said.::::::::Her decision to use private e-mail was for convenience, Clinton said. ""I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.""::::::::But Representative Trey Gowdy, who has subpoena power as the Republican leading the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, said Tuesday that he was not satisfied and still wanted a third party to examine her server to ensure that she had turned over all relevant e-mails to the panel and to the State Department.::::::::Speaking to more than 100 reporters, Clinton sought to explain why she used a personal account, how she used that account and whether it had been sufficiently secure, all in hopes of pushing back on at least some of the scrutiny she has faced since March 2, when the New York Times first reported on her e-mail practices.::::::::Clinton said repeatedly that she regrets her decision to use a single e-mail address. ""Looking back, it would've been better that I had simply used a second e-mail account and carried a second phone,"" she said. ""But at the time this didn't seem like an issue.""::::::::Convenience was the only factor that Clinton cited in explaining her decision as she took the helm at State in 2009, and she did not discuss whether there was any concern then among her aides that the single account would later prove to be a liability.::::::::Clinton stressed Tuesday that she adhered to all the relevant federal records laws and policies during her four years in the Obama administration by saving and handing more 30,490 work-related messages to the State Department that were identified by a ""thorough process"" run by her staff.::::::::She chose to delete the 31,830 messages that her team deemed personal and private, out of respect for her own privacy and the privacy of those with whom she was corresponding. ""I chose not to keep my private personal e-mails–e-mails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes,"" she said.::::::::""No one wants their personal e-mails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,"" she said.::::::::Clinton asserted that her messages had been secure since her server had originally been used for former President Bill Clinton's e-mail traffic, had ""numerous safeguards"" and was physically secured by the Secret Service at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.. The account, she said, was never hacked and she ""did not e-mail classified material.""::::::::After the news conference, Clinton's office released a fact sheet offering more details on issues related to her e-mails and declined to say much about the security measures that were in place because ""given what people with ill-intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices.""::::::::Her office offered a 'trust us, it's safe explanation,' writing: ""suffice it to say, robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available, including consulting and employing third party experts.""::::::::One outstanding question was whether Clinton had used her e-mail account to communicate with foreign officials, and her office said that its review of her archives found only one message to a foreign official, from the United Kingdom. Otherwise, she ""communicated with foreign officials in person, through correspondence, and by telephone.""::::::::Asked during the news conference about her views on questions about the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign governments such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that have dismal records on women's rights–another issue that flared in recent weeks–Clinton held firm. ""I'm very proud of the work the foundation does,"" she said.::::::::Just before Clinton's news conference, the State Department was in the midst of reviewing the 55,000 pages worth of correspondence that Clinton had turned over to fulfill her obligations under the Federal Records Act. Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that state would also turn over e-mails pertaining to the Benghazi terrorist attacks to the House Select Committee investigating the U.S. government response to the incident.::::::::Clinton and some of her closest advisers hoped that the issue would fade and that she could postpone an extensive accounting of her e-mail practices until after she launches her presidential campaign, almost certainly in April.::::::::But as the story stayed alive over the weekend, the pressure for her to speak out only intensified, as a small but influential group of Democrats began publicly urging her to speak out. Clinton’s plans started coming into focus Monday afternoon, as allies confirmed that she needed to answer questions to have any hope of moving on.::::::::The United Nations is an unusual setting for a U.S. political press conference, and simultaneously gave Clinton’s team an easy way to control access to the event and while offering a convenient contrast between her discussion of women’s rights issues inside the meeting room of the UN Economic and Social Council and the political event in a hallway.::::::::In her speech, Clinton addressed the progress made on women’s rights in the two decades since the UN’s 1995 Beijing conference. Speaking ahead of Clinton, UN Women executive director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka referred to Clinton as a “future president,” drawing big cheers.::::::::The scene ahead of Clinton’s speech was chaotic as political reporters spent the morning waiting in line for UN credentials and scrambling to confirm the time and location of Clinton’s availability. No official information was forthcoming until close to noon, when Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill began responding to journalists’ questions.::::::::Merrill described what was planned as “a brief press conference,"" though it ultimately went for just over 20 minutes.::::::::The scene also hearkened back to Clinton's 1994 ""pink press conference,"" when she tried to respond to pent-up tensions about Whitewater and other controversies by addressing reporters' questions from the State Dining Room of the White House.::::::::Back then, she told reporters that her sense of privacy ""led me to perhaps be less understanding than I needed to of the press and the public's interest–as well as right–to know things about my husband and me."""
"32683"	"2015-03-11"	"Associated Press sues State Dept over Clinton emails"	"The Associated Press said Wednesday it has sued the State Department to force the release of government documents and emails from Hillary Rodham Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, an action taken a day after she defended her use of a private e-mail account to conduct business.::::::::""After careful deliberation and exhausting our other options, The Associated Press is taking the necessary legal steps to gain access to these important documents, which will shed light on actions by the State Department and former Secretary Clinton, a presumptive 2016 presidential candidate, during some of the most significant issues of our time,"" AP General Counsel Karen Kaiser said in a statement.::::::::""The press is a proxy for the people, and AP will continue its pursuit of vital information that's in the public interest through this action and future open records requests,"" Kaiser said.::::::::At a news conference following a speech at a U.N. conference on women's economic status Tuesday, Clinton defended her use of a private e-mail account, saying it was done for convenience. Using a personal account was permissible during her tenure as long as she kept the records, and she did not discuss classified information on her personal e-mail, Clinton said.::::::::""Looking back, it would have been better for me to use two separate phones and two separate e-mail accounts,"" Clinton said. ""I thought using one (mobile) device would be simpler. Obviously, it hasn't worked out that way.""::::::::Clinton sent or received 62,320 total e-mails while heading the State Department, and deleted 31,830 that she deemed personal.::::::::She turned over 30,490 e-mails to the State Department last fall at its request. More than 27,500 involved official government e-mail addresses.::::::::Clinton said she ""chose not to keep"" personal e-mails, such as those related to daughter Chelsea's wedding in 2010 or the funeral for her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who died in 2011. ""No one wants their personal e-mails made public and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,"" she said."

"32717"	"2015-03-11"	"Controversy over email pushes issue of trust to forefront for Clinton"	"The controversy over Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of a private email account while secretary of state has accelerated an inevitability about her presidential candidacy – a spotlight on whether Americans trust her.::::::::Clinton has lived in the public eye for nearly a quarter of a century, and over that time her political opponents have found that issues of trust can serve as powerful weapons against her.::::::::As far back as 1996, when she was first lady, a survey by the non-partisan Pew Research Center asked people to offer one-word descriptions of Clinton. The labels most often used by admirers were “strong” and “intelligent,” while the ones most raised by opponents were “dishonest” and what Pew decorously described as “a derogatory term for women that rhymes with rich.”::::::::The accusation that Clinton can’t be trusted or isn’t honest has served as a rallying cry for opponents ever since. They’ve been helped at times by Clinton’s own actions. Her penchant for control and secrecy – or as she has put it, a desire to preserve some privacy while leading a public career – repeatedly has led Clinton into situations where many Americans believed she was, at best, skirting rules that others were expected to follow.::::::::The intense partisanship that has divided opinions about Clinton through most of her public career has focused on that part of her personality. A year ago, for example, when she was still perceived by many Americans more as an admired former secretary of State than as a presidential candidate, another Pew survey found widespread agreement among Americans that Clinton was “tough.”::::::::But asked whether she was “honest,” Democrats and Republicans differed sharply, with more than 80% of Democrats saying yes, while only 30% of Republicans agreed. As partisan gaps have widened among American voters, views about Clinton have remained highly polarized.::::::::Given that history, it was only a matter of time before the trust issue came to the fore in the presidential campaign.::::::::Many Democrats say they were resigned to that.::::::::“I think this is just the warm-up to everything the Republicans plan to do for the next 10 years. Hillary Clinton is the front-runner not only for the Democratic nomination but in head-to-head races against Republicans,” said Jim Demers, a longtime Democratic activist and prominent Clinton supporter in New Hampshire, the first primary state. “They’re aiming their artillery at her early.”::::::::But the fact that the trust issue has surfaced already, and that Clinton and her aides responded slowly, has dismayed many Democrats.::::::::“It hasn’t been an encouraging pre-game,” said a former official in Bill Clinton’s administration who supports Hillary Clinton and who, like most high-level Democrats, would criticize her performance only anonymously.::::::::“It’s obviously problematic,” the former official said. “People don’t really trust the Clintons. They may like them, but they don’t trust them. I think she should be in a period of ‘show me’ rather than ‘trust me.’”::::::::The debate over Clinton’s emails has increased worries among Democrats about the lack of a campaign organization on their side months after Republicans began setting up their operations, and it appears to have accelerated the schedule for Clinton to formally announce her candidacy, likely next month.::::::::In her news conference Tuesday, Clinton said she had decided when she became secretary of State that she would use a private email account as a matter of “convenience” because it meant she could use one account for both personal and work emails and carry a single phone.::::::::Last year, when State Department officials asked her and her three immediate predecessors to turn over copies of any work-related emails they had on private accounts, Clinton said, she had her lawyers review the roughly 60,000 emails she had sent during her tenure – which works out to about 40 per day – and separate messages related to official business from those that were private.::::::::The review turned up 30,490 work emails, which were printed out and given to the State Department, and 31,830 “private, personal” messages, which were deleted, her aides said in a statement.::::::::Clinton defended her deleting of the personal messages on grounds of privacy, couching her argument in terms that seemed aimed at connecting with the voters who probably will be judging her next year.::::::::“No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,” she said. The personal messages touched on matters such as her daughter Chelsea’s wedding, the funeral of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, and even her yoga classes, she said. She did not say why deleting the emails was necessary to keep them private.::::::::Critics immediately fired back, saying Clinton and her aides could have used the opportunity to delete emails that were politically embarrassing or could have provided evidence of wrongdoing.::::::::“We don't get to grade our own papers in life,” said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chair of the special House committee investigating the attack in 2012 on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.::::::::“She doesn't get to determine what's a public record and what's a personal record. Someone else needs to do that,” Gowdy said Wednesday on MSNBC. He repeated a call for Clinton to allow an outside party to examine the email server kept at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.::::::::So far, most Democrats have defended Clinton. The lack of criticism within the party eases the way for her nascent campaign to chalk up criticism to Republican partisanship. Polls since the controversy began have shown no erosion in the strong support that likely Democratic primary voters give Clinton, who holds huge leads over potential rivals both nationally and in early primary states.::::::::Among the few Democrats willing to openly criticize her is Richard Harpootlian, the former South Carolina Democratic chairman, who has long been a harsh judge of the former secretary of State.::::::::“The big question now is what did she delete and why did she delete it?” Harpootlian said.::::::::“Given the history, she should be more sensitive than any other American to make sure she is transparent. ‘Trust me’ isn’t enough. It’s amazing to me she calls a press conference 10 days after this break and says, ‘Trust me,’” he added. “I’m sorry, tell me why. Why should we trust you?”"

"32786"	"2015-03-11"	"How Hillary Clinton answers on e-mail flap created more questions (+video)"	"Clinton's response to questions on her use of a private e-mail account for official State Department business doesn't answer concerns about hacking or whether she used this account to communicate with representatives of foreign nations.::::::::Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a news conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Tuesday. She fielded questions on her use of a private e-mail account during her years as secretary of State.::::::::Last week, we learned for seemingly the first time that, while she was secretary of State from 2009 through the beginning of 2013, Hillary Clinton solely utilized a private e-mail account that was set up on a server that was kept in her home rather than an official State Department e-mail account. Rather than going away like a one-day story, the story has percolated in the political media thanks in no small part to the fact that new revelations and questions seemed to be coming out every day while the White House and State Department both seemed to be rather ham-handed in their response to questions about how it came about the Clinton was allowed to do this back in 2009, what kind of security was involved, who had control over the server itself, and whether or not Hillary Clinton had ever communicated with the president or other White House personnel using her personal e-mail account. Through it all, though, there was almost no response from Hillary Clinton outside of a single tweet when the story first broke. Obviously, her advisers had hoped the story would die out on its own, but it became apparent by the time the new week began that this wasn’t the case so, on Tuesday, the former secretary of State addressed the media after an appearance at the United Nations, but her statements created as many questions as they answered:::::::::Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday defended her exclusive use of a private email address during her time as secretary of state as a matter of “convenience,” saying that about 30,000 of her work-related emails would be made public, but that thousands more that she deemed personal had been deleted. “I thought using one device would be simpler; obviously, it hasn’t worked out that way,” she said in her first public comments since the issue emerged last week. She said that most of her emails were work-related, went to government employees and were captured on government servers. Mrs. Clinton said that the State Department would make public all of her work-related emails, but that her personal email – about issues such as her daughter’s wedding and the death of her mother – would remain private. “I feel that I have taken unprecedented steps to provide these public emails; they will be in the public domain,” she said. Mrs. Clinton spoke for about 20 minutes during a news conference, delivering a statement on women’s issues and denouncing moves by Republican lawmakers to undermine efforts for a nuclear agreement with Iran, before turning to the controversy over her emails. Expressing a mix of regret and defensiveness over the matter, Mrs. Clinton emphasized that she broke no laws. “I fully complied with every rule,” she said, adding that no classified material had been sent on her email. However, she remained steadfast that she would not turn over personal emails and said that those messages in fact had been deleted. “They were about personal and private matters that I believed were in the scope of my personal privacy and particularly that of other people,” she said. “They had nothing to do with work. I didn’t see a need to keep them.” The State Department said on Tuesday that it would publish online the full set of emails provided by Mrs. Clinton from her time as secretary of state. “We will review the entire 55,000-page set and release in one batch at the end of that review to ensure that standards are consistently applied throughout the entire 55,000 pages,” said Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman. “We said we expect the review to take several months; obviously that hasn’t changed.” A smaller set, about 300 emails that had been provided to the select House committee on Benghazi, will be released earlier to the public. The State Department also said it would give any reasons for redactions, in accordance with Freedom of Information Act guidelines.::::::::Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign began on terms set by her adversaries – with a defensive Clinton telling reporters she won’t release half of the emails sent from a controversial private email account set up while she was Secretary of State and suggesting that they may not exist anymore. Clinton, with the poise and clarity of a mid-campaign politician, said her decision to send departmental emails through a private email server at her suburban New York house was a matter of “convenience,” and that she regretted not keeping parallel government and private accounts. “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,” she said when asked if any of her emails compromised security. “Looking back, it might have been smarter” to have used government email, she conceded. At times, the former first lady, who answered about ten questions, seemed to contradict herself, saying at one point that she had destroyed her personal emails, then suggesting they remained – off limits – on her family’s private server. Clinton said her lawyers had examined all of her emails, about 60,000 in all over four years at Foggy Bottom, and sent every government-related missive – about 30,000 – to the State Department in the hopes that all would be released to the public on the Web. Yet in an act of defiance certain to stoke a new round of questioning, Clinton said she had no intention of turning over any of the approximately 30,000 emails she deemed “personal” for the sake of her family’s “privacy” – exchanges she said included planning for daughter Chelsea’s wedding and her mother’s funeral, correspondence with her husband and her yoga schedule. “Going through the emails, there were over 60,000 in total, sent and received. About half were work-related and went to the State Department, and about half were personal,” said Clinton. “I had no reason to save them, but that was my decision. “For any government employee, it is that government employee’s responsibility to determine what is personal and what is work-related.” When a reporter asked her if she planned to allow an independent commission to examine all of the emails on her personal server, she responded with a flat – no way. “The server contains personal communications from my husband and me,” Clinton said of the system, which was originally set up to handle Bill Clinton’s post-presidential correspondence. “And the server will remain private.” No one, not even Clinton’s most erstwhile defenders, thought the press conference would end the firestorm over the emails. “Look, the problem here isn’t about the emails, you guys are never going to be satisfied with whatever answers she gives,” said former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville. “Y’all are just going to go out there and say, ‘She raised more questions than she answered.'” Today’s event at the United Nations was an exercise in a hastily-organized crisis management – staged a few feet away from a copy of Picasso’s Guernica, a gruesome depiction of raw human suffering during the Spanish Civil War. It featured none of the genteel stagecraft and personal dignity Clinton as a politician and private citizen craves – a push-and-shove tabloid press scrum in front of 25 TV cameras – more “Bonfire of the Vanities” than “Woman of the Year.” Clinton’s staff says the time had come to defend herself after taking a week’s worth of incoming fire, but it came at a staggering opportunity cost – the chance to defining the aspirational terms of her candidacy to come, a campaign which will be based on her role as a gender pioneer and desire to articulate a post-Obama vision for saving the middle class. Completely lost in the noise was the speech Clinton delivered Tuesday, which was intended to underscore the rhetorical highlight of her four-decade career in politics, her 1996 speech in Beijing declaring women’s rights identical to human rights. “She’s taking a huge risk here,” said a longtime adviser, as Clinton prepared to take questions. “I don’t think she has a choice, but things could go wrong.”::::::::Near the top of the press conference, after she had made statements regarding the speech she had just given at a United Nations forum and comments about the letter sent by Senate Republicans regarding the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, Clinton answered the question that everyone had been wondering about from the beginning; namely, why she chose to set up a private e-mail account for official business. Her explanation, that it was a matter of “convenience” because she didn’t want to carry around two mobile devices, is one that many people have expressed skepticism about. After all, as anyone who owns a current model iPhone, Android, or Blackberry smartphone can tell you, it most certainly is possible to have more than one e-mail account on a mobile device at one time. I’ve had a setup like that from the first time I owned a smartphone, which roughly dates back to the time when Clinton first became secretary of State. The Washington Post’s Philip Bump brings up, as others have since the press conference ended, the possibility that the phone Clinton was using, which was apparently a Blackberry, didn’t allow two accounts at the same time. However, it’s worth noting that, at the same time that Clinton was secretary of State, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was able to have personal and official e-mail accessible on his Blackberry. At the very least, then, Clinton’s claim that the decision to use a personal mobile device and an e-mail server that she and her husband had personal control over rather than a government device and an e-mail account tied in to government e-mail servers was purely a matter of “convenience” just doesn’t withstand the credibility test.::::::::Clinton also says that she and her advisers reviewed all of the e-mails on her personal account and turned over anything that was work-related to the State Department, that at least some portion of what she considered to be her “personal” e-mail was deleted, and that she would neither be turning over the personal e-mail for review nor the server for any kind of forensic examination. In other words, she’s asking the press and the American public to trust her, and only her, to make the determination of what is work-related and what is personal. Obviously, this would not have been an issue at all had she used a separate, government-provided, e-mail account for official business to begin with, but once she started commingling the two, it strikes me that there must be something more involved in the review process beyond “trust me.”::::::::Finally, Clinton’s response today did nothing to answer the questions regarding the security issues that seem rather self-evident here. Just how secure was this private server that Clinton utilized, for example? She said today that the server had been set up when her husband left office and that it was “guarded” by the Secret Service, but that doesn’t really answer potential concerns about hacking, which has nothing to do with the physical security of the server. It’s also unclear whether regular backups were made of the server, and who has control over those backups, and whether or not encryption was used in her communications with State Department and other government employees. It’s also unclear at the moment whether she ever used this personal e-mail account to communicate with representatives of foreign nations, which would raise security issues all its own.::::::::If Hillary Clinton’s intention in Tuesday’s press conference was to try to put this story to an end, then I would say that she failed miserably in that regard. At least for the moment, this story is not going away.::::::::Doug Mataconis appears on the Outside the Beltway blog at http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/."
"32931"	"2015-03-12"	"Democrats struggle to defend Hillary Clinton's emails"	"WASHINGTON — Democrats struggled Wednesday to defend Hillary Clinton’s email practices in the wake of her first public remarks on the matter, while Republicans threatened to use subpoena power to get the information they are demanding.::::::::After Clinton on Tuesday acknowledged deleting 30,000 emails that she said were personal, backers were left with little to say beyond urging voters to take her word for it.::::::::“In the end, you either trust the Clintons or you don’t trust the Clintons,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “And I fundamentally trust her.”::::::::Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said Clinton has “said she complied with all the federal laws. There is nothing I know that counters that. She is doing what I had hoped she would do, and that is to make a full disclosure.”::::::::The Democrats’ comments came as party members accepted the email issue will likely dog their expected 2016 nominee into her presidential campaign.::::::::A Lesson for Hillary: New York teens show how easy it is to add an extra email account to a smartphone::::::::Democrats do not think Clinton’s often defensive news conference Wednesday will end the scandal, but are hoping they can close ranks and give attacks a partisan appearance.::::::::“I’m frankly a little sick of the email drama,” former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is eyeing a 2016 bid, said while adding that he didn’t see her press conference and therefore couldn’t comment on what she had said.::::::::“This is an issue for the media in D.C.,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is considering a challenge to Clinton from the left, told the Daily News. “This is not a major issue in Vermont.”::::::::Clinton’s camp reached out in recent days to Democrats and progressive groups to address concerns about the email scandal, with longtime Hillary aide Huma Adedin and spokesman Nick Merrill contacting lawmakers.::::::::There was no indication Clinton had personally reached out to Democrats.::::::::“I’m satisfied with what I’ve received,” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said.::::::::“My sense of trust is a little bit lost,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a likely 2016 candidate, said Wednesday on NBC. She was supposed to put the emails on a government server and she didn’t, and now she says . . . ‘trust me now that the ones I deleted weren’t pertinent.’ ”::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs a House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack, said Wednesday that he wants an independent review of Clinton’s email server, which Clinton has said she will not make available. Gowdy acknowledged he lacked power to force Clinton to release control of her server.::::::::Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said his panel will seek access to the electronic versions of Clinton’s emails, not just printed copies, and was prepared to issue a subpoena if necessary.::::::::A spokeswoman said Chaffetz plans to send the State Department a letter on Friday requesting Clinton’s emails, and will subpoena them if necessary.::::::::“Subpoenaing Hillary Clinton is not the chairman’s initial preference, but the committee retains the authority to do so,” said Chaffetz spokeswoman Melissa Subbotin.::::::::ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

"32950"	"2015-03-12"	"Here's What Hillary Clinton Must Do to Prevent 'Emailgate' From Becoming an Electronic Watergate"	"Hillary Clinton stated during her recent press conference that, ""No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy."" This is true, however most Americans aren't being sued by the Associated Press for access to their 62,320 emails from 2009 to 2013. This lawsuit alone, in addition to the possibility of becoming the first female president in American history, separates the former Secretary of State from every other person who values privacy.::::::::When asked why she used personal emails exclusively, Clinton answered ""I opted for convenience to use my personal email account...because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two."" Again, this could be true, however there are plenty of Americans who use multiple cell phones, email accounts, computers, and even cars for work related purposes. A 2014 Wall Street Journal article titled People for Whom One Cellphone Isn't Enough explains that many Americans actually choose several devices for both convenience and safety:::::::::The average U.S. home had 6.5 Internet-connected devices at the end of 2013, up from 5.6 devices in 2012, according to NPD Group's Connected Intelligence/Connected Home Report. ...The safest assumption, Ms. Sotto says, is, ""if you are co-mingling work and play, you should expect that your employer could seek access to the 'play' data."" ...Hilda Canes Garduño, a 37-year-old resident of Fairfax, Va., says she has no expectation of privacy as a project manager for the federal government. Her work may be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, internal investigations and litigation. ...It wasn't hard mastering two operating systems for her two different phones, Ms. Canes Garduño says. The real challenge is keeping everything charged. ...It has become second nature, says Ms. Ifshin, who has had a smartphone since 2007, her freshman year of college. ""I guess I feel like if I'm going to have any devices, I may as well have two.""::::::::Unlike Clinton, the people interviewed in The Wall Street Journal article have no problem with utilizing several devices at once. In fact, many claim that owning several cell phones is even more convenient than just one. In addition, the article explains that people use multiple devices to enhance security; an issue that Clinton has dodged from the beginning of the scandal.::::::::Like Nixon and Watergate, the longer Clinton evades turning over her emails, the greater the chance that people associated with the former Secretary of State will be asked to lie on her behalf. Similar to Watergate, people could end up resigning from her staff or feel the pressure to leak the information. Or, loyal aides could help her circumvent responsibility from explaining the existence of what The Atlantic describes as a ""private server that Clinton was running out of her Chappaqua home.""::::::::Therefore, below are four steps Hillary Clinton and her team should take in order to address the scandal from a moral, not simply a public relations (and they're failing at that) perspective. This controversy is about trust, not the rule of law. If the four steps below are addressed quickly, rather than in a tortured process of lawsuits and awkward press conferences, Americans will quickly forget this scandal and move on to other news.::::::::1. Hand over all of the 62,320 emails so that the AP lawsuit goes away.::::::::There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton broke any laws or rules.::::::::So, why is this a controversy?::::::::It's a big story for three reasons. First, she has yet to disclose all of her emails. Second, her emails were stored in a private server at her home. Third, the public does not know if ""homebrew"" servers were safe. Wired has called it a ""security fail.""::::::::Once the Associated Press has all her records, there won't be any need to battle a lawsuit. Hillary Clinton won't have to answer any questions related to the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, the issues regarding her private servers and potential ""security fail"" will be mitigated by the fact all her records are in the public domain.::::::::2. Allow a third-party to pick and choose the emails to disclose to the public.::::::::::::::::Clinton explained that she was forthright in handing over emails by stating ""I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totaled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them."" However, the Clinton team decided which emails to hand over to the government.::::::::According to CNN, it was Clinton's choice which emails stayed and which ones were disclosed:::::::::This is an enormous dilemma that Clinton must address sooner than later. She should allow a third-party to sift through her remaining emails, in order to undermine any political attacks in the future that question why she chose to keep certain communication as private.::::::::The GOP won't be able to say a word about transparency in 2016 if this dilemma is addressed quickly by Team Clinton.::::::::3. Explain why private servers, storing public information, were located in a residential location.::::::::""This is the biggie,"" according to The Washington Post.::::::::Hillary Clinton defiantly claimed ""The server will remain private."" However, her servers are inherently public since federal communication traveled through these servers. Her decision to store them in her home didn't shield them from becoming public domain; it exacerbated the problem. A recent Wired article states, ""the security community is focused"" upon the potential of sensitive information possibly being compromised on Clinton's servers.::::::::According to CNN, Americans can look at Clinton's reasoning in two ways:::::::::Trust will be a key issue in 2016, so an honest answer to this issue will help gain any swing voters lost from 'Emailgate'. The issue of security will also be addressed since the servers can be analyzed.::::::::4. Make sure the Freedom of Information Act isn't a point of contention in 2016.::::::::POLITICO's Josh Gerstein wrote an article titled Hillary Clinton email flap not likely to end soon, explaining why the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a key issue in prolonging the story:::::::::Once Clinton discloses the remaining emails, explains clearly why private servers were used (convenience might not be the only issue), and assures the public that no security breaches took place, then any issues with FOIA will cease to remain contentious topics.::::::::In his iconic interview with David Frost, Nixon stated ""It snowballed, and it was my fault."" More press conferences, or ""press encounters,"" will only hurt Clinton's chances in 2016. I want Hillary Clinton in the White House instead of Bush, Walker, or any other Republican. However, battling both the GOP and an AP lawsuit won't help in securing another Democratic presidency. Once Clinton addresses the issue of secure servers, remaining emails, and questions regarding security, 'Emailgate' will become simply another political attack, rather than a serious scandal."

Clinton downplayed concerns that official emails could have been lost by suggesting anytime she emailed anyone with a "".gov"" address, that email would be stored for posterity.::::::::""The vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department,"" she said Tuesday.::::::::But department spokeswoman Jen Psaki made clear on Friday that this was not the way the system worked.::::::::She said the department only started automatically archiving emails for other senior officials in February.::::::::""They have long been planning to do this.

"33601"	"2015-03-14"	"Hillary Clinton's prickly reaction to email row could be fatal to 2016 hopes"	"For Hillary Clinton , it must all seem like a distant dream: for four years as her country’s top diplomat she was officially exempted from the gravitational forces of America’s divided politics.::::::::While at the State Department she was allowed to float free, briefly enjoying the political equivalent of weightlessness, released from the bitter back-and-forth and her own troubled political history.::::::::For a time she even made jokes, playing along with the ‘Texts from Hillary’ internet craze – acerbic and self-deprecating in her Jackie O dark glasses, Blackberry always in hand. When she left the State Department her personal public approval hovered at a near-celestial 69 per cent.::::::::Well, it didn’t last long. If Mrs Clinton had harboured any lingering hopes that she might waft her way into the White House in 2016 on a cloud of good works and a record of achievement, she was disabused of them on Tuesday at the United Nations.::::::::Inside the auditorium she was still playing the international ambassador - promoting women's empowerment before a friendly audience of diplomats and activists – but out in the hallway reporters were queueing up to ask the question that had been splashed across every newspaper and TV news bulletin for over a week: “What happened to all those emails?”::::::::Mrs Clinton said she had used a private email address for the sake of “convenience”, and had deleted some 31,830 emails which she deemed “personal”, an explanation which only served to further rile her critics.::::::::The inquisition clearly infuriated Mrs Clinton: not just the impudence of those who dared question her integrity but also – as she would see it – the relentless, trivialising force of the modern media that always prefers froth to facts; nit-picking to policy.::::::::But therein lies one of Mrs Clinton’s biggest problems if – as everyone expects – she announces a run for president in 2016.::::::::More than ever, she seems incapable of hiding her hostility towards those who would challenge her. After years in the tank filled exclusively with presidents and prime-ministers, she’s become the political equivalent of a puffer-fish: the slightest provocation elicits a prickly response.::::::::That’s what undid her when questioned by Congress in 2012 over her handling of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi that left a US ambassador dead on her watch - “what difference does it make?” she demanded.::::::::And again during her book tour last year when questions were raised about her personal wealth and $250,000-a-pop speaking engagements – “You have no reason to remember, but we came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,” she said, to gales of laughter.::::::::Though she tried to fight the impulse, she did it again this week at her press conference. She started trying to make nice, but when confronted with perfectly legitimate questions about why she deleted all those ""personal"" emails before anyone could review them, it was not long before the tone became defensive, scratchy.::::::::As so often with Mrs Clinton, who has suffered as much criticism over the years as anyone could reasonably endure, the bristle reflex was partly understandable.::::::::In using a personal email, she had done nothing that former secretaries Albright, Powell and Rice had not done before her, and no-one had accused them of cover-ups, she complained. So trust me, she asked, as you once trusted them.::::::::But therein lies a second problem; clearly not enough people do trust Mrs Clinton; many are Republicans, but the doubters also include much of the so-called “liberal media” that Republicans accuse of giving Mr Obama a free pass these last six years.::::::::“Deleter of the Free World” and “You’ve Got Fail!” screamed the New York tabloids, while others mocked the wildly implausible “convenience” defence, noting that Mrs Clinton has had no problems juggling multiple devices since leaving the State Department, recently admitting to owning two iPads, one iPhone and a Blackberry.::::::::For those old enough to remember, this all has an exhausting familiarity to it. On this week’s performance, those who remember the first Clinton administration could be forgiven for asking if America really wants to return through the looking-glass to Clintonland; not least because Mrs Clinton looked none too sure she wanted to be there herself.::::::::And for younger voters for whom Monica and Whitewater are someone else’s history, Mrs Clinton risks increasingly coming across as just another member of the insular, self-serving Washington political establishment that has earned the US Congress record-low public approval ratings.::::::::In fact, with those astronomical speaker fees, her cloth-eared remarks about being dead-broke (delivered from the sitting room of her Washington mansion) and the hauteur that comes with spending too long at life’s top-table, Mrs Clinton is in danger of being the Mitt Romney of 2016.::::::::She looks out of touch, out of fresh ideas and – if Republicans can find a younger, non-establishment candidate who feels the frustrations of modern America – maybe out of time too."

"33623"	"2015-03-14"	"Hillary Clinton's email, and the pitfalls of transparency, accountability, and trust"	"At a press conference earlier this week, Hillary Clinton addressed the growing controversy over her clandestine email server. She was less than convincing.::::::::She said she used a non-governmental email address while serving as secretary of state because she didn’t want to carry two phones—doesn’t everyone hate that? But not long ago she said that she did indeed use two phones (an iPhone and a Blackberry).::::::::She also pointed out, repeatedly, how unprecedented it is to ask the state department to publicly release her emails. Except, everyone has been quick to note, she will give access only to about half (about 30,000) the emails she received while serving as a secretary of state. The others were personal in nature and have been deleted.::::::::One of the journalists attending the conference asked:::::::::Well first of all, you have to ask that question to every single federal employee, because the way the system works, the federal employee, the individual, whether they have one device, two devices, three devices, how many addresses, they make the decision.::::::::So, even if you have a work-related device with a work-related .gov account, you choose what goes on that. That is the way our system works. And so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands, maybe millions of people to make those decisions. It is a truthful response, but not a particularly satisfying one. On this, and all other behind-closed-doors communications featuring government figures, citizens must simply trust their elected officials. Trust is at the core of any democracy—it’s what makes it possible for citizens to delegate power to someone else to exercise on their behalf. But in return for that trust, officials must offer accountability. At any given time, they should be prepared to answer to their constituents about how they are wielding the power they have been given. Trust and accountability aren’t the same thing, and one can’t replace the other. Clinton violated both. She broke citizens’ trust by not following protocol and instead relying on a personal email run via a private server. And she didn’t offer accountability when, asked to reveal her correspondence, she made the selection herself of what was deemed to be of public interest. And while accountability can be restored—the state department now uses a system that automatically archives the emails of senior officials, and there could yet be a way to access all the emails Clinton sent so that a disinterested observer can decide what’s private or not—trust is gone. It can be rebuilt, but the process is slow and painstaking. It is a commodity that is hard to gain but easy to lose. For citizens, this is a wake-up call. Monitoring electronic communication is easier than ever, as overzealous intelligence agencies have shown. But transparency isn’t the same as accountability, and won’t generate trust on its own. It is not necessarily a good idea to publish every email publicly, but there should be confidence that this is at least an option. If Clinton’s email system wasn’t so convoluted, and the sharing process not so shrouded in mystery, there would be much more faith that officials were making unimpeachable, objective decisions in the public interest. Then, people would never have lost their trust in Clinton, which was evidently misplaced."
"33642"	"2015-03-14"	"Bill and Hillary Both Make Statements on the Email Scandal. Guess Which One is Telling the Truth?"	"On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton finally broke her silence over what has been dubbed “Email-Gate.”::::::::During a brief presser, Clinton defended her use of a private email server, claiming absolute transparency and compliance with State Department standards and practices. However, one thing she said has some raising eyebrows.::::::::The Hill reports that during the press conference, former Secretary of State Clinton said:::::::::“The server contains personal communications from my husband and me, and I believe I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private and I think that the State Department will be able, over time, to release all of the records that were provided.”::::::::Hillary Clinton’s remark, however, stands in stark contrast to what The Wall Street Journal reported mere hours before the press conference:::::::::“The former president, who does regularly use Twitter, has sent a grand total of two emails during his entire life, both as president, says Matt McKenna, his spokesman. After leaving office, Mr. Clinton established his own domain that staff use–@presidentclinton.com. But Mr. Clinton still doesn’t use email himself, Mr. McKenna said.”::::::::New York Magazine noted today that Bill Clinton has famously joked about his lack of email prowess, saying in 2011:::::::::“I sent a grand total of two emails as president, one to our troops in the Adriatic, and one to John Glenn when he was 77 years old in outer space. I figured it was OK if Congress subpoenaed those.”::::::::While a large number of Twitter users were content to repeat the same joke:::::::::Others were quick to latch on to the seeming contradiction:::::::::Some on social media did come to Sec. Clinton’s defense, asking if the correspondence which Hillary was referring to was between herself and her husband, via his staff:::::::::As of yet, neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton have clarified whose statement was made in error.::::::::However, some believe the Clintons will just stonewall until the question simply goes away:"
"33645"	"2015-03-14"	"It was risky as hell, but the crazy thing is that Hillary Clinton's home email server ..."	"Responding to mounting questions, Hillary Clinton—the former US secretary of state and a presumptive presidential candidate—said this week that she “opted for convenience” by using a personal email account instead of her official one.::::::::But let’s be real: There’s absolutely nothing convenient about setting up a private email server, as Clinton says she did in her Chappaqua, NY home. And security experts say her system may have had vulnerabilities that could have exposed correspondence to hackers and government snooping.::::::::Setting up a server is no simple task. “It’s a pretty big job to maintain a server like that and make sure it’s properly configured,” says Peter Firstbrook, an internet security researcher at Gartner. Firstbrook tells Quartz that such an endeavor is “highly unusual.” He has not heard of any companies whose executives had set up personal servers for work emails, let alone government officials.::::::::To set a personal email server, someone would need to:::::::::A private server would need to be set up by someone who knows what they are doing, Firstbrook said—most likely, some sort of IT professional employed specifically to set up the system. This professional presumably would then have to continue working to maintain security systems and deal with any breaches.::::::::This server system could have cost thousands of dollars to set up, Robert Siciliano, an internet security expert, tells Quartz. If the Clintons used high-end equipment, purchased licenses for operating systems and email programs, and bought powerful antivirus and anti-spam software, the costs would have been considerable. “The more security, more money it would’ve cost,” Siciliano said.::::::::Although it’s unusual and a lot harder than using a service such as Gmail, the Clintons would not be the first people to set up a private home server. Ars Technica published a step-by-step guide to setting up an email server last year. Siciliano said, however, that this activity is “not for the faint of heart.”::::::::A home server allows someone complete control over their digital correspondence. Emails do not live on a server in a datacenter that companies may be sifting through for ad targeting—they live on a hard drive in your living room. In the Clintons’ case, they may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties—whether commercial, hacker, or government—were able to snoop on them. Hillary Clinton said at her press conference on March 10 that the server had originally been set up for Bill Clinton after he left office.::::::::This doesn’t mean that a home server would block against all sorts of malicious attacks. The Clintons would still have had to make sure they didn’t leave themselves vulnerable to being duped into giving up their passwords, just like anyone else. Ideally, they would have used complex passwords that couldn’t be easily guessed, and “two-factor” security, which requires proving they had access to a second device or service—typically, a mobile phone or special passcode fob—to log in.::::::::One of the many unanswered questions is whether any administrators or other individuals had access to the Clintons’ emails, especially communications with foreign leaders or the president. For a personal server would to be airtight, it would need to be constantly monitored and updated.::::::::“To say it wasn’t compromised is to say, ‘I don’t know it was compromised,’” Stewart Baker, a former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, told Politico.::::::::Firstbrook said that there is sophisticated auditing software out there that would allow the Clintons to see exactly who had read their emails and when, but it’s unclear whether they used it. Quartz contacted the office of Hillary Clinton for comment, as well as the Clinton Foundation, but has not received a response.::::::::There is a high likelihood that the system was designed to be as secure as what the government itself uses to manage email, said Siciliano. Experts agree that the Clintons’ set-up was most likely quite sophisticated, according to Scientific American.::::::::It’s unclear, however, if the server was monitored as hawkishly as government servers are because of the high probability that they will be targeted by hackers. “Government cybersecurity experts know that government servers will be compromised no matter what, so they are fully prepared to get hackers off the system as soon as possible,” Alex McGeorge, a security researcher at Immunity Inc, told Business Insider.::::::::That said, even the government’s servers are not without their security flaws: The State Department itself had one of its email systems hacked last November.::::::::By hosting her own email, Clinton was essentially trying to remove security issues associated with the broader, public cloud, Siciliano says. When using a cloud-based email service, like Gmail or Yahoo Mail, personal information resides on a company’s server that the individual has no control over, and could potentially be be breached by hackers. A home server, Siciliano said, is “kind of like putting your money in your mattress.”::::::::Before Clinton spoke publicly about her decision to run her own server, Al Jazeera America reported that the State Department advised her to use a government server, as her server was “at greater risk of being hacked,” but she ignored that advice.::::::::Forbes reported that the server was likely unencrypted for the first three months Clinton was in office, which would have made it extremely vulnerable to hacking. Kevin Bocek, a researcher at the internet security firm Venafi—who discovered the gap in security—said in a blog post that the server that ran the Clintons’ clintonemail.com had no digital certificate when it was first online in early 2009. (Digital certificates help web browsers and smartphones tell if servers are really what they claim to be, Bocek explained to Quartz.)::::::::Although clintonemail.com now has a certificate, Bocek said the greater concern is that someone could have acquired the Clintons’ passwords while the server had no certificate. Hillary Clinton was traveling in countries where internet networks are set up to allow the state to perform eavesdropping—such as China—while the server was unsecured, Bocek said.::::::::There is no evidence to suggest that the Clintons have been hacked. But any foreign or US government agency—or private voyeur—could have theoretically accessed that server during that three-month window and continued to observe their communications.::::::::Clinton’s rationale that a home server was more convenient seems a weak one. And it’s hard to imagine that anyone who has absorbed the details revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden could really believe their email communications to be completely private.::::::::But it’s also plausible that the Clintons’ could have actually been a safe and secure system. While it created some security vulnerabilities, the secretary of state also would have had complete, personal control over her emails, and this may have influenced her decision not to use a government address. However, it has now created a controversy that isn’t going away—which seems hardly worth the tradeoff."

""And when it comes to my approval ratings, I still can't.""::::::::No, seriously, folks. Remember, he told the white-tie crowd of elite journalists, when he was considered the tech-savvy hipster in the executive mansion? But now, ""Hillary has a server in her house!"" he exclaimed. ""I didn't even know you could have one of those. I am so far behind.""::::::::Only in Washington does this scene not necessarily strike people as strange: Hundreds of reporters hobnobbing with the government officials they normally cover in an evening of fine dining and parody songs that make Weird Al Yankovic seem hip. Oh, and even though it's an event thrown by a group of journalists, guests are told not to spoil the fun by publishing anything.::::::::But that's the Gridiron Club's annual dinner, a tradition of goofy skits, silly songs and music by the United States Marine Band that has remained virtually unchanged since 1885.The night, at its core, is unabashedly sentimental — the main objective is to promote ""good fellowship.""::::::::The president — back at the dinner for a third time — told the room that Democrats had determined they needed to do better with older white voters.::::::::""Which is why I'm here,"" he said. He noted that if the crowd laughed at his jokes more than the last time he was around in 2013 there might be a reason for it.::::::::""I'm not saying I'm any funnier,"" he said. ""I'm saying weed is now legal in D.C.""::::::::The dinner is a love letter to a Washington that never really existed — a romanticized place where politicians, despite all the squabbling, share an abiding respect for each other, the press and the political process. If it was ever true, it's certainly not now — but it's must be nice to pretend for a few hours.::::::::Why is this night different from all other nights? Because on this night, when Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker makes a joke about Hillary Clinton, it's not part of a future negative ad campaign.::::::::""I really do have a lot of close friends who are Democrats,"" said Walker, serving as the official Republican speaker for the evening. "" I even have Hillary's private email. . . It's HillaryClinton@Wallstreet.com. You know the best part of that joke, Elizabeth Warren wrote it for me.""::::::::Big laughs all around, even though soon enough half the room will be out to get him. And it didn't take long for someone to get retribution. But only jokingly of course.::::::::""I'm sure Governor Walker has some really neat accomplishments,"" said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. ""I mean, it's literally been years since his own constituents tried to recall him.""::::::::Obama got in on the Walker bashing a little too, but made sure to poke fun of himself in the process.::::::::""[Walker] punted on the question of evolution, which I do think is a problem,"" Obama said. ""I absolutely believe in the theory of evolution — when it comes to gay marriage.""::::::::With a guest list of 650 — a fraction the size of the much-hyped White House Correspondents' Association dinner — Gridiron is arguably a far more coveted ticket within Beltway circles. Gridiron is also the most insular of the city's press dinners. None of the speakers have to play to C-SPAN or CNN cameras, so they keep it for Washington, by Washington, with insider jokes designed for VIP political junkies who breathlessly parse every off-hand aside for hidden meaning.::::::::And if that's not you? Well, at least. . . .::::::::""This is great people watching,"" said Aneta Bazzie, a visitor here for an unrelated event — a conference of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials — as the crowd of famous-for-Washington types, dressed to the nines, paraded past her into the Washington Renaissance Hotel.::::::::""Who's that?"" her friend Susan Gillette asked, pointing at Andrea Mitchell in a sparkling ball gown.::::::::""Who's that?"" Bazzie asked about political scion/MSNBC personality Abby Huntsman. ""You should write down she is wearing a nice dress.""::::::::""Who's that?"" Gillette asked about Democratic ad maker Mark Putnam, and then about former Sen. Ben Nelson, and then about Valerie Jarrett.::::::::""Oh I know you!"" Bazzie says running up to Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, and pointing to her sweatshirt bearing the name of their shared home state. ""We're from West Virginia."" All politics is local.::::::::It was Obama's third appearance at Gridiron since becoming president; he originally seemed to avoid such Beltway traditions but seems to have raised his tolerance for them.::::::::White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest broke away from a conversation with Politico reporter Mike Allen to head into the dinner. ""It'll be all right,"" he predicted. ""Everything's in better form when the president's here.""::::::::He was joined by an array of guests that included Cabinet members, congressmen, diplomats, baseball legend Hank Aaron, TV news personalities Wolf Blitzer, Gayle King and Chris Matthews; and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.::::::::""I'm just going to sit quietly and hope the president doesn't notice me,"" said possible Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. He was on his way to change into his tux in the gym, when the hotel's general manager spotted him and gave him a free room for the evening.::::::::Not at the dinner: Supposed 2016 frontrunners Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. (Walker joked that the Gridiron Club ""couldn't afford her."")::::::::But oh, she was present in spirit. The controversy over Clinton's private email account is exactly the kind of personality-driven saga that Gridiron loves to mock in its ever-corny song skits. To the tune of Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off,"" naturally:::::::::Don't need you so I'll take, take, take, take, take::::::::Take you out, take you out.::::::::Or at least that's what we're told they did. One of the many peculiarities of the event is that the 65 members of Gridiron represent some of the most influential editors and political reporters in the nation's capital — and yet the dinner is closed to the press who would cover it. Which means this story, as always, is cobbled together from a viewing of the dress rehearsal, glimpses of the script, transcripts from helpful staffers and the damp cocktail-napkin scribblings of sympathetic guests.::::::::The skits are a mixture of hokey and slick, the journalists dressed in elaborate costumes but often bolstered by strong-voiced ringers for the song parodies. There were male reporters playing Colombian prostitutes in a Secret Service skit. There were puns and bad jokes but nothing damning: The same reporters who appear on Sunday morning talk shows decrying the letter GOP senators sent to Iran had nothing to say about it on stage.::::::::That fell to the president. ""You don't diminish your office by taking a selfie,"" he said. ""You do it by sending a poorly written letter to Iran. Really. That wasn't a joke.""::::::::The humor can be broad. There was a skit portraying the massive field of Republican presidential aspirants, all dressed in marathon garb: Rick Perry was portrayed as a dunce, Ben Carson insane, Rand Paul an overreaching know-it-all, Scott Walker a drop-out, Rick Santorum an egomaniac, Mike Huckabee an opportunist, and Jeb Bush as a guy saddled with an unfortunate moniker (sung to the Wizard of Oz's ""If I Only Had a Brain""):::::::::You should judge him on the merits::::::::Not his much too famous name::::::::That he could be a new man::::::::If he had another name.""::::::::And the Koch brothers were portrayed as ultimate king makers (to the classic Coke commercial tune):::::::::""We'd like to buy the world for Koch::::::::There's a billion we will spend::::::::We pay to play in the USA::::::::The midterm shellacking of the Democrats was mocked with Johnny Cash's ""I've Been Everywhere"":::::::::Not just out Senate lair, man::::::::We did not have a prayer, man::::::::We're in need of some repair, man::::::::Are you beginning to get the picture? There were nods to Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, gay marriage, the Secret Service and McAuliffe, who was called ""most ambitious man alive"" in a song poking his quest for higher office (to Fleetwood Mac's ""Don't Stop""):::::::::He'd stop at nothing to win::::::::But as any politician will tell you, it's better to be mocked than ignored. (Oddly, no mention of Marco Rubio, despite what looks like a serious campaign ramp-up. And Bobby Jindal? We hardly knew ye.) There was, as always, a toast to the president and the entire room linking arms and singing ""Auld Lang Syne."" A fantasy, like Cinderella's, that always ends by midnight."

(NYC) | Star Max/IPx::::::::Every election cycle can be considered, first and foremost, a monument to hype. With every passing week, the political world is a blizzard of brash predictions, bold pronouncements, and bad advice. This year, your Speculatroners shall convene every Sunday and attempt to decode and defang in a way that will hopefully leave you feeling unharmed and less confused. We hope this helps, but as always, we make no guarantees!::::::::Since the beginning of March, the singular story of our long-running pseudo-event known as the ""2016 presidential race"" has been former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her emails. This week, it became a matter which Clinton herself finally got around to addressing at a press conference, in which she explained that her decision to commingle State Department and non-State Department emails on a single email domain of her choosing was a decision borne from desired convenience, which has ended in no small amount of regret.::::::::As I noted earlier this week, one of the most interesting things about Clinton's sudden email problem is that it probably can't be solved to anyone's satisfaction. The underlying assumption is that there is some email, somewhere, that has managed to escape proper oversight. No matter how many emails Clinton discloses, if this imagined missive fails to materialize, it will always be thought of something that's being hidden, as opposed to something that does not exist. The only solution is for none of this to have happened in the first place -- and it's not as if this required some super-genius amount of foresight to prevent.::::::::Rather than solve the problem, it must simply be endured -- and not just by Clinton herself. Whatever you think of this email micro-event -- be it the intimation of a larger disorder, or one more shiny object of diminishing value -- the fact is that it has altered the ""invisible primary"" in some measurable way for Clinton's allies, her opponents, and the media tasked with covering the story. Today, we'll put everyone under the microscope -- and on the couch -- to see where this story is going, how it might end, and how everyone copes along the way. As with anything in American politics, everyone is unhappy in their own way.::::::::As with any super-popular public figure, Hillary Clinton enjoys the affections of devotees for whom the mere notion that this story constitutes something scandalous is preposterous, and who are quick to point out that other current political figures (most notably GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) have email sins of their own. Naturally, this is something of a contradictory position to take, but the underlying emotional rationale is one in which Clinton-philes feel that their candidate is uniquely persecuted.::::::::As Harry Enten reported this week over at FiveThirtyEight, Democrats in general hold the opinion that the media reserves its sharpest elbows for the former first lady:::::::::But trends do not prove monoliths, and if you examine the way party elites and activists have responded to the email flap, you don't see a blind ""blame the press"" strategy. Instead, you see a growing demand for Clinton to just get on with her campaign already. That marks a big change from the halcyon days of late January, when everyone seemed more or less resigned to the fact that Clinton was going to afford herself ""the luxury of time"" because, as one anonymous source put it, ""She's better off as a non-candidate. Why not wait?""::::::::But if Clinton wanted some sort of well-manicured campaign rollout, it's looking more like that won't be in the cards. As Politico's Gabriel DeBenedetti reported this week:::::::::The value of jumping into the race with both feet just as the heat from this email flap is at its height is pretty simple: You get to change the subject. You get to outline and defend policy positions and priorities, and give the teeming masses in the political media something more esoteric to chew on for a while. In short, you start playing your game. As one anonymous Democratic strategist told DeBenedetti, “When she announces that she’s running, that’s when this will fade away.”::::::::Or, so that person hopes. Let's face it, if it were a sure thing that this problem was so easily dissolved, that source would be known by name, instead of by ""a national Democratic strategist familiar with the emerging campaign structure and plans.""::::::::Of course, there's a world of Democrats outside of the Clinton fan base, including a fairly significant number of people who have dedicated their lives to convincing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to ruin her life and run for president, presumably to Clinton's left. From that camp, we've seen a trickle of reactions to this email controversy that all basically amount to, ""Why always Hillary?""::::::::As H.A. Goodman writes in these pages, ""However, there's an alternative to constantly defending Hillary Clinton from real or fabricated accusations and controversies. Her name is Senator Elizabeth Warren."" The interesting thing to note is the way Goodman characterizes the act of righteously defending Clinton from ""fabricated accusations and controversies"" as something that's not worth the effort.::::::::The only problem, of course, is that Warren is not running, and Democrats do not have a particularly deep bench. That's why the ""crap or get off the pot"" faction is likely to get their way, pushing Clinton into proper campaign mode by April. At which point, she'll welcome the delicate knives of her rivals in the GOP.::::::::Obviously, all of this attendant controversy has been good news for the GOP, because this story weaves well with many pre-existing media narratives (the Clintons are, by nature, secretive) and oppositional talking points (the Clintons will do anything to win). And with Clinton looming large as a near-untouchable primary contender, Republicans will take no small amount of satisfaction in the fact that she won't get through the pre-primary season unbuffeted.::::::::Nevertheless, it would appear that some sort of natural anxiety has seeped in on the Republican side, as the mouth of this irresistible gift horse clamors for gaze. As GOP strategist Ed Rogers writes in The Washington Post, ""Meanwhile, Republicans have reacted in a somewhat bipolar fashion. They’ve sloshed from, 'Oh no, Hillary Clinton is invincible' to 'Oh no, Hillary Clinton might not be the Democratic nominee in 2016.'”::::::::Is it possible that after all of this, Republicans would rather run against Hillary Clinton than someone else? That would evince far more confidence in the Democrats' second string than even the Democrats have mustered at this point. And yet, you can find people sharing these sentiments. Over at American Thinker, J. Robert Smith says that the question, ""Would our party nominee be better off with Hillary or another Democrat?"" is ""more than an arm-chair debate"":::::::::Obviously, most of that is predicated on a broad critique of ""establishment Republicans"" and some ostentatious assumptions about ""the left"" being engaged in a process to ensure Hillary doesn't run, but there is a danger, at least in theory, in the ""candidate to be named later."" And with current opinion polls telling our media that the people are hot for change, there's something reassuring about fighting Hillary Clinton in a general election when you presume she won't be able to embody something ""new"" in fitting enough fashion.::::::::Elsewhere, there is the notion that somehow, the GOP will blow this. Clinton's ""foes,"" writes Time magazine's David Von Drehle, ""almost always overplay their hand"":::::::::The whole notion of the GOP always shooting themselves in the foot when they've got a clear sight at the target naturally comes in for some mockery in some circles. And yet, over in Politico Magazine, feisty GOP flack Rick Wilson makes it clear that this is one of his chief worries, urging Republicans to ""stay out of the way of [Clinton's] email fiasco"":::::::::Of course, ""never interrupt your opponent when they're making a mistake"" is, in American politics, advice that is offered almost as often as it goes unheeded. But it goes to show that old GOP hands know this ""overplay the hand"" tendency well enough.::::::::Of course, the main target of Wilson's piece may not be Republicans at all, but rather the media.::::::::The Media: One nation under a backlash::::::::""While the media’s passive 'attention span' excuse du jour is real,"" Wilson writes, ""many in the press are possessed of a boundless ideological desire to change the subject right now.""::::::::There's scant evidence that this notion is true. The political press seems rather united on the notion that Clinton's press conference failed to end the story and continued to raise concerns. As of now, The Associated Press and Gawker have filed separate lawsuits against the State Department to gain access to Clinton's missing emails. Every indication is that this story shall persist for some time.::::::::Still, it's a pretty nifty bit of ""working the refs"" from Wilson, and it neatly encapsulates the delicate position the press is in. If media outlets run at the story with the willy-nilly spirit of their typical foolishness, they could end up resembling the very creatures that Harry Enten's poll respondents imagine -- wild-eyed gaffe patrols eternally chasing after the shiny object. Give up on the story too soon, and they'll become another caricature: the in-the-tank liberal media. (And even though this story wouldn't exist without determined reporting, you can bet that if the flap ends up not hurting Clinton, the press will be accused of ""burying the story."") Either way you turn, backlash looms.::::::::Meanwhile, it's anybody's guess as to whether the people pursuing this story are doing so with any mind to what they should even be looking for, exactly. Time's Von Drehle pinpoints one area of interest, the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Per Von Drehle:::::::::Still, it's not clear that everyone's wading into this story with a solid game plan. The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza says that he's ""stuck on"" the number of emails deemed private, and indeed, he offers no indication as to whether he's considered the distinction between quality and quantity. CNN's Laura Koran made a game attempt to illustrate what a pending release of Clinton emails might ""look like,"" but never really gets past what's likely to be excluded from such a release to reckon with what might be there.::::::::And the answer, of course, is that there may be nothing extraordinary in those emails at all. Of course, there could also be any number of embarrassments -- intemperate remarks, unexpected criticism, blunt analysis -- that might be dredged from Clinton's emails, as might be dredged from our own. So the story could just as easily end up in ""What about your gaffes?"" territory as it might end up exposing some dodgy synergy between Clinton's State Department office and her family's foundation.::::::::Of course, there's something to this whole story that does speak to the public interest. As Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel opinion columnist Ernst-Ulrich Franzen notes, there's a wider, better debate to be had:::::::::Cheers to Franzen for making the effort to elevate the conversation. Also, please accept these commiserations when this substantive conversation fails to materialize.::::::::Hillary Clinton: Is it all really worth it?::::::::And what of Clinton herself? The events of the last two weeks have raised a slew of old questions. Frank Rich took to his regular New York Magazine Q&A column to lament, ""But the more important question is why the Clintons, who more than anyone in American politics understand the high risks of perceived improprieties, have left Hillary’s campaign so vulnerable even before it is officially out of the gate.""::::::::These concerns were echoed by The Guardian's Megan Carpentier:::::::::Meanwhile, Rich's New York Magazine colleague Jonathan Chait says that the ""larger problem for Clinton, though, is not the likelihood that her emails will turn up incriminating evidence."" Rather it is ""what this episode reveals about her political judgment and managerial acumen.""::::::::All of which may be overcomplicating the problem. A more fitting question might be: ""Does Hillary Clinton actually want to do this for the next year and a half?"" Based upon how little she enjoyed her first tilt with a skeptical press, you have to think that going on for hundreds of days more will require a stouter resolve than most masochists are prepared to offer.::::::::The pundit class, at the moment, is hung up on the public's desire for novelty and change, because it looks like there's a better-than-even chance that both parties' nominees might end up being dynastic throwbacks. But all of that may be a mere placeholder for public opinion, until the sparring begins and the public gains a firmer foothold into what the big ideas of the 2016 race might end up being.::::::::Nevertheless, even if a lack of dynamic newness isn't a barrier to competing for the White House, a lack of optimism almost certainly is. And that's what's missing from Hillary Clinton's outward-facing campaign, such as it is at the moment: any sign of brightness or buoyancy, or the notion that there is something hopeful, energizing the Clinton candidacy with purpose. Inevitability -- that quality that Clinton is said to have in abundance -- doesn't mean much when it seems as if what's inevitable isn't any fun.::::::::Somehow, some way, Hillary Clinton is going to have to find some way of proceeding on this path with something that resembles cheerfulness, and which presents a Clinton candidacy as an exuberant, positive thing in which to play a part. It can't look like a constant slog of pessimism and recriminations, otherwise the feeling expressed by H.A. Goodman, in which defending Clinton is a drudge even when the cause is right, will become widespread.::::::::Clinton's been at this for a long while now, and while during that time, she's come to be thought of as having presidential timber, she's also managed to acquire a few decades of resentments, which she seems to keep too close at hand for her own good. Now, she's got to find a way to legitimately enjoy running for president. That probably means that she's got to somehow put these ancient grievances out of her mind, lest she be consumed by them. If only she could delete them as easily as an email.::::::::Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"

As examples, Clinton said some of the deleted emails were related to planning the wedding of her daughter Chelsea, funeral arrangements for her mother and her yoga routines and preferences.::::::::ABC News said it had been briefed by top Republicans on the coming investigation but had no additional details.::::::::Clinton, who is expected to announce a 2016 presidential bid as early as next month, has found herself embroiled in another potential scandal, as questions remain over why she used only a personal email account — based on a computer server run out of her house in Chappaqua, N.Y. — for all official correspondence at the State Department.::::::::Last week, she claimed that she simply “saw it as a matter of convenience” to use one account and that she “fully complied with every rule” she was governed by that pertained to disclosure and security compliance.::::::::Clinton has said she wants the public to have access to all of her remaining emails and has asked the State Department to release them, but she also told reporters she would not turn over her private server for examination by congressional investigators or a neutral third party.::::::::At the center of the controversy, some Republicans have claimed, are other lingering questions stemming from an ongoing special House committee investigation into Clinton’s role in the U.S. response to the fatal Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.::::::::On Sunday the leader of that probe, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, said he wanted Clinton to testify about her email practices before Congress by April.::::::::“I have zero interest in looking at her personal emails. I don't care about her yoga practice. I don't care about bridesmaids dresses. I don't want to see that. But who gets to decide what's personal and what's public,” Gowdy said on “Fox News Sunday. “And if it's a mixed-use email and lots of emails we get in life are both personal and some work, I just can't trust her lawyers to make the determination that the public is getting everything they're entitled to.”::::::::Gowdy, nevertheless, said he had yet to see any proof that Clinton had done anything illegal and maintained that his demands for access to the rest of the emails had nothing to do with thwarting Clinton’s likely presidential bid.::::::::“We haven't seen obviously any evidence of a crime,” he said, but “I have no guarantee that we have everything that we're entitled to, to be able to do our jobs.”::::::::""I have no interest, zero interest, in you and I having this conversation in 2016, but I don't get to decide how quickly it's done, I need some cooperation from people who have access to the witnesses and the information,"" Gowdy added on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”::::::::While the ongoing chatter over her emails has some Clinton fans worried over her 2016 prospects, one of her biggest advocates, James Carville, didn’t appear worried Sunday.::::::::“I’ve had maybe three people come up to me and say, ‘Well, I’m for somebody else other than Hillary.’ And I know I run into more Democrats in more places than maybe anybody else in the United States,” Carville said on “The Cats Roundtable"" radio show. “ I don’t know how much data you can get, but who am I to tell Senator Webb or Governor O’Malley, who I both know, that you can’t run. You’re not going to win. But if you want to waste your time, that’s your business.”::::::::Possibly bolstering Carville’s claim was a report Sunday morning that former Jeb Bush, an early front-runner for the GOP 2016 nomination, had himself used his own personal email for official matters during his time as Florida governor.::::::::Bush, The Washington Post reported, used his private email account to discuss security and military matters — including the protection of nuclear plants and Florida National Guard deployments to the Middle East.::::::::Bush aides told The Post that none of the emails contained sensitive or classified materials."

Some said that was a sloppy approach, because it might have excluded some work-related messages that didn’t happen to include those keywords.::::::::Over the weekend, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said a keyword search was used, but clarified further that this process was used only after each email was “reviewed” individually.::::::::“Every email was reviewed,” Merrill said in an email, according to the Wall Street Journal. Merrill said a fact sheet handed out by Clinton’s team showed examples of keyword searches, but failed to mention that these searches were an attempt to “double and triple check they were capturing everything.”::::::::“This was NOT in lieu of reading them all, [it] was in ADDITION to reading them all,” he added. “We did not mean to imply otherwise.”::::::::“We simply took for granted that reading every single email came across as the most important, fundamental and exhaustive step that was performed,” he added, according to Fox News. “The fact sheet should have been clearer in stating that every email was read.”::::::::If true, that clarification could go a long way toward assuring people that Clinton didn’t simply eliminate tens of thousands of emails without looking more closely to see if any work-related information was included in them.::::::::But it still leaves Clinton’s team in the position of being the sole arbiter of whether an email should be made public, or whether it should be scrapped — a situation that seems unlikely to appease Republicans who are still investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi and Clinton’s reaction to that attack.::::::::The State Department has said it would likely redact many of the emails it has from her that it plans to release in the coming weeks. Additionally, State said it may not release entire emails depending on the information they contain.::::::::House Select Committee on Benghazi Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) has subpoenaed Clinton’s emails himself, and over the weekend, it was reported that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) may soon announce another House investigation into Clinton’s use of emails. Boehner’s spokespeople had no comment about that possibility for TheBlaze just before noon on Monday."

"It’s possible that Hillary Clinton may ask this particular surrogate to stop helping, at least for the moment. It’s not just that he’s made one stumble. It’s also that he’s living history, a walking, raging embodiment of all the old Clinton uproars.::::::::James Carville, a political commentator known for leading former President Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, speaks to attendees of the 37th Annual Mansfield Metcalf Celebration in Helena, Montana March 7.::::::::Is James Carville hurting Hillary Rodham Clinton more than he’s helping her? That’s the question rattling around the punditocracy this morning following Mr. Carville’s inelegant defense of Mrs. Clinton’s use of personal e-mail on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.::::::::Carville’s long been a staunch Clintonite and one of the former first couple’s primary surrogate spokesmen on television. He’s been all over the cable shout shows ever since news broke that as Secretary of State Clinton relied on a home-brew private e-mail server. His primary line: it’s nothing, just business-as-usual; something Colin Powell and other Secretaries of State did too.::::::::“It’s made up. You take pi, you subtract 3.1415 and you don’t end up with very much,” Carville told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.::::::::But Carville also said this, in a rare unguarded comment: “I suspect she didn’t want Louis Gohmert rifling through her e-mails, which seems to me to be a kind of reasonable position for someone to take.”::::::::Republicans pounced on this as an inadvertent admission that Clinton was just trying to avoid legitimate congressional oversight. You see, Representative Gohmert is a GOP member of the House from Texas, a member of the Judiciary Committee who’s an outspoken conservative. To put it mildly.::::::::Clinton might want to avoid Gohmert’s scrutiny, but as an administration official she’s not really supposed to do that, at least as far as members of Congress are concerned.::::::::At the least, this is a sensitive subject that the Clinton camp would want Carville to avoid. Instead, he should have gone on a trademark rant, where he becomes red in the face and fires out an emotional defense of his subject in the Louisiana accent that earned him the nickname “Raging Cajun.”::::::::As performance art these rants are really quite impressive. But his offhand comment will give Republicans a talking point they’ll be waving around for days.::::::::“Team Clinton is going to have to ask their surrogates to stop helping, and soon. At this rate, Clinton’s backers are going to help her right out of the race,” writes Noah Rothman at right-leaning Hot Air.::::::::We agree with that first sentence, partly. It’s possible that Clinton may ask this particular surrogate to stop helping, at least for the moment. It’s not just that he’s made one stumble. It’s also that he’s living history, a walking, raging embodiment of all the old Clinton uproars, up to and including impeachment.::::::::That’s not the image Clinton wants to dwell on when she runs for president. She’ll want to portray herself as modern, forward-looking candidate. Remember, her likely campaign manager Robby Mook is 35. Clinton is reaching for younger, tech-savvy leadership for her 2016 effort.::::::::As to whether the e-mail uproar will upend her ambitions, and drive Clinton from the race, we remain unconvinced things are anywhere near that point. This is a classic partisan uproar, in which D.C. elites pay lots of attention, but the public doesn’t, with the bottom line being that committed partisans are made more committed in their beliefs, on both sides.::::::::On March 9, a Pew poll found Clinton’s e-mails to be only the fifth-most followed news event of the week, a tick below the Supreme Court argument on the Affordable Care Act. Even this rating was based mostly on great interest among Republicans, who aren’t going to vote for Clinton anyway.::::::::Thirty-four percent of Republicans said they were following the story closely, according to Pew. The corresponding number for Democrats was 16 percent. That was the widest partisan divide on any news story rated in that particular Pew survey."

At the same time, half found her to be ""honest and trustworthy,"" compared to 56 percent who said the same when they were asked that question a year ago.::::::::The CNN poll also probed respondents' views on the e-mail story itself. The findings were mixed, with majorities saying it was a problem on some level and that she needed to explain herself more—but also that Clinton has revealed the ""right amount"" about her e-mails.::::::::Just over half of respondents said her use of a personal address and home server was very or somewhat of a serious problem, compared to 48 percent who had it was not too serious or not a serious problem at all. More than half of the survey-takers also said Clinton had not done enough to explain why she used a private e-mail system.::::::::Fifty-one percent said Clinton had revealed the right amount about the e-mails, while 41 percent said she'd revealed too little. And 52 percent agreed with the statement that her handling of e-mail while serving as secretary of state is not relevant to her character or her ability to serve as president.::::::::The telephone survey, conducted by ORC International, was of 1,009 adult Americans and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Drilling down in the poll results, just 31 percent of Democratic voters viewed the e-mail issue as a problem, while 51 percent of Independents did and 75 percent of Republicans.

The former first lady is under fire after reports that she used personal email accounts on a private server based out of her Chappaqua, New York, home.::::::::At a press conference in New York last week, Clinton asserted it was out of “convenience” she used a private account rather than one provided by the federal government. “I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously it hasn’t worked out that way,” Clinton told reporters.::::::::The former secretary of state reportedly deleted about 31,000 emails she deemed to be personal and submitted more than 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department as per the Federal Records Act.::::::::Clinton also said she went “above and beyond” what the law said for compliance regarding the preserving of her emails.::::::::Daniel Metcalfe, the founding director of the Justice Department’s Office of Information and Privacy (OIP), had a different point of view. “What she did was contrary to both the letter and spirit of the law,” he told CBC News last week. Metcalfe helped four different administrations, including the Clinton administration, interpret the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).::::::::“There is no doubt that the scheme she established was a blatant circumvention of the Freedom of Information Act, atop the Federal Records Act,” he continued.::::::::Democratic strategist James Carville, a Clinton confidant who helped engineer Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, said on the “This Week” panel Sunday that Hillary Clinton “didn’t want [Rep] Louis Gohmert [Republican from Texas] rifling through her emails.” Carville also contended the investigation into the emails “amounts to nothing but a bunch of people flapping their jaws about nothing.”::::::::Share this if you support an investigation by the full House of Representatives."

"34261"	"2015-03-16"	"Clinton Emails Rekindle Benghazi Panel Infighting"	"Nearly 10 months after the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Benghazi, its chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy, stepped in front of a lectern in the U.S. Capitol on March 3, flanked by four Republican committee members. They were there to respond to the New York Times story on Hillary Clinton's exclusive use of a private email account while she ran the State Department, a bombshell that reverberated throughout the political community and thrust the Benghazi panel into the national media spotlight.::::::::“Despite some attacks from those who claim that all questions regarding Benghazi have been asked and answered, the revelation that Secretary Clinton uses personal email accounts lays that claim bare,” Gowdy said. “It also lays bare the claim that any other committee has issued the definitive report on Benghazi.”::::::::Besides breathing new life into the select committee on Benghazi, the Clinton email disclosure re-ignited a bitter partisan battle that erupted after the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Libya that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead.::::::::Republicans, who insist the attack has never been fully documented or explained, say getting to the bottom of it is important not only for the victims’ families but also to help prevent future attacks on Americans overseas and for U.S. security in general.::::::::Democrats maintain that questions surrounding Benghazi have been thoroughly investigated and put to rest. They accuse the GOP of stoking a tragedy in an effort to discredit Clinton, the party’s presumed 2016 presidential front-runner, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack.::::::::Days after the Times’ scoop, Gowdy’s committee subpoenaed Clinton’s personal emails and called on her to turn her private server over to a neutral arbiter. He also said the panel will ask Clinton to appear before it to address the email and records issues and to answer questions about the Benghazi attack, a long-anticipated event likely to create an even bigger media buzz saw for the embattled Clinton.::::::::The Obama administration initially said the attack on the consulate compound and nearby CIA office was conducted on a mob enraged by an anti-Islamist video. That turned out not to be the case –it was planned and carried out by militants with ties to terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda – and Republicans have long been critical and suspicious of the administration’s early handling of it.::::::::Seven subsequent U.S. investigations of the attack -- spearheaded by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence -- concluded security was inadequate at the CIA site, but there was no intelligence failure before the attack.::::::::In May 2012, the House formed the 12-member Select Committee on Benghazi on a mostly partisan vote. Most Democrats immediately criticized it as a waste of taxpayer money, claiming the attack had been thoroughly investigated and that the new select committee was a partisan political ploy.::::::::Speaker Boehner pushed back and said the committee “doesn't need to be, shouldn't be, and will not be a partisan process.” But soon after, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., dubbed it “the Select Committee on Talking Points.” Democrats considered boycotting but ultimately decided to join the panel.::::::::Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor from South Carolina, runs the investigation the way he would run a grand jury, say panel members. The well-credentialed panel consists of seven Republicans and five Democrats, several of whom serve on Intelligence and other House committees that previously investigated Benghazi, and the majority are attorneys, some with experience as federal prosecutors.::::::::At the committee’s third meeting, in January, Democrats complained GOP members had conducted witness interviews without them, hadn’t requested any documents in months, and were unfocused and moving too slowly.::::::::“All of this points to a goal and objective of this committee that doesn’t have much to do with finding out the truth and doesn’t have much to do with preventing future attacks,” Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said at the hearing.::::::::Gowdy has consistently said that his sole purpose is to follow the facts wherever they lead. He and other Republicans say their hands have been tied by certain factors, such as a slow response by the State Department.::::::::“In my view, it has taken far too long for the State Department to produce documents,” said committee member Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind. “They’ve known this was going to be coming since September of 2012, and here we are in 2015. Documents and information should have been provided long before now.”::::::::Additionally, though the department has turned over 55,000 pages of emails, GOP lawmakers point to gaps in them, sometimes as long as weeks. Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, another Republican committee member, says the iconic photo of the former secretary of state checking her Blackberry aboard a plane to Libya in 2011 illustrates the point. Gowdy has said the committee has no emails from that entire trip.::::::::“That’s the one thing that concerns the committee is: are there emails out there that we haven’t seen?” Westmoreland said. “We have her in pictures emailing on a plane going over to the Middle East but we don’t have any emails from that date. Was she emailing a relative? We don’t know. But you’re on your way to the Middle East, you’re on your way to Libya, it seems like these emails would give us some information about what you’re going to do on your trip.”::::::::Republicans also argue previous committees’ jurisdictions prevented them from investigating the full scope of the attack – Intelligence could only investigate the intelligence community, Armed Services the military, etc. – but the  select committee has cross jurisdiction and can bring together and deepen the previous investigations.::::::::“We’re going to be able to talk to more eyewitnesses, more individuals who were there that night than the other committees,” Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan told RealClearPolitics. “And you take the work that the other committees have done, you take what you learn from the eyewitnesses, there’s documents we still haven’t received from the State Department, so all that is designed for us to get to the truth.”::::::::Gowdy and other GOP committee members say they have tried to keep committee activities out of the headlines, in part to avoid being accused of trying to torpedo Clinton. They knew Clinton used a personal email months ago, but did not leak that to the press, for example, Gowdy said.::::::::Jamal Ware, an aide to Gowdy and communications director for the committee, said committee members remain focused solely on investigating the attack.::::::::“After 10 months, the GOP-led committee still has no answer to the question – as it pertains to the secretary's emails or anything else – just what are we looking for?"" California Rep. Schiff, a Democrat on the select committee, said in a statement after Clinton’s personal email had come to light.::::::::A Democratic House aide summed up: “The problem with that is that all of these (previous Benghazi) reports are pretty definitive and there are a very few questions left unanswered.”::::::::The panel’s March 6 decision to subpoena Clinton’s emails further infuriated Democrats, who said they were not consulted first. In a letter to Gowdy the next day, all five Democrats called on the chairman to withdraw the subpoenas and publicly release emails Clinton has already provided to the committee. Gowdy has said he will not release the documents in the committee’s possession until he is certain he has all the documents requested.::::::::“Allowing those emails to be made public will help clear up any misconceptions and will also help return the committee to its original purpose, investigating the tragic events in Benghazi, rather than allowing it to become a surrogate for the Republican National Committee,” the Democrats wrote.::::::::Later on CNN, Schiff repeated those claims: “Nothing changed except that the pressure on the Republican members of the committee this week became too great for them to resist from the Stop Hillary PAC people, and the RNC people, so they issued a subpoena for records we already have.”::::::::Ware, the select committee spokesman, rejects any suggestion of political shenanigans. “If we wanted to make political hay, we’d be making partial releases and we’d be leaking stuff, and that is not how Chairman Gowdy works,” Ware told RCP.::::::::In an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press over the weekend – his second Sunday show appearance in as many weeks – Gowdy said he hopes to conclude his investigation by the end of this year. But he added that the timeline depends on the cooperation of those being questioned.::::::::""I have no interest, zero interest, in you and I having this conversation in 2016, but I don't get to fully decide how quickly it's done,” Gowdy said. “I need some cooperation from people who have access to the witnesses and the information."""
"34431"	"2015-03-17"	"Boehner Joins Call for Review of Clinton E-Mail Server"	"(Bloomberg) -- Republican U.S. House Speaker John Boehner joined calls for Hillary Clinton to turn over her private e-mail server to an outside arbiter, saying the “American people deserve all the facts.”::::::::Boehner said an outside review is the only way to determine if congressional investigators into the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have what they need.::::::::“That’s why it’s so important for Secretary Clinton to turn over her personal server to a neutral third party,” Boehner said Tuesday after a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. “That is the fairest way to make sure we have all of the documents that belong to the public, and ultimately all of the facts.”::::::::Clinton, secretary of state from 2009 until early 2013, used a private e-mail address and a home server while in the job. Her office said March 10 she gave 30,490 work-related e-mails to the State Department, which is reviewing them for public release. Another 31,830 e-mails, which Clinton said involved personal matters such as wedding planning or yoga routines, were deleted.::::::::Lawmakers could subpoena her computer equipment to find out if she withheld messages containing government business, which could trigger a legal battle.::::::::“There’s no reason why the House can’t subpoena a former official for records that are in her possession,” said Aziz Huq, a professor at the University of Chicago who teaches and researches constitutional law.::::::::As long as it’s an issue of legislative business or connected with congressional oversight, the Republican-led House has wide leeway to vote to authorize a subpoena for Clinton’s e-mails and the contents of her server, Huq said. The House Oversight & Government Reform also could issue subpoenas, but courts give greater weight to those issued from the full congressional body, he said.::::::::In response to demands from Republicans seeking access, President Barack Obama could seek to claim executive privilege, an argument weakened but not entirely undermined by the fact that the e-mails are from Clinton’s private system on her property in New York, said Mark Rozell, a George Mason University professor of public policy.::::::::“The burden would be on the president and administration to make the case that the release of the e-mails would hurt the national interest,” Rozell, author of a book on executive privilege, said in an interview. “There may have to be some process where the e-mails are reviewed in private.”::::::::Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House’s oversight panel, has said he would prefer not to subpoena Clinton but his panel is looking into the issue of her communications.::::::::The Benghazi committee, led by South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy, has already subpoenaed the State Department for materials and sent letters to Internet service providers to preserve any records they may have.::::::::At the request of Clinton’s lawyers, the committee on Tuesday extended the deadline by two weeks for her to respond to a March 4 subpoena seeking communications related to Libya. The new deadline is March 27.::::::::Gowdy granted a “reasonable extension because this is not about politics, it is about getting all relevant documents,” committee spokesman Jamal Ware said in an e-mail.::::::::Gowdy has said that the panel lacks authority to issue a subpoena for the Clinton server, and a vote by the full House may be needed to get the equipment.::::::::“He still believes the best option for Secretary Clinton is to turn over he server to a neutral arbiter to independently determine what should be in the public domain,” Ware said. “The committee has no interest in her personal e-mails.”::::::::Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday on the possibility of a subpoena. In a press conference last week, Clinton balked at handing over the unit.::::::::“The server contains personal communications from my husband and me, and and I believe I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private,” she said.::::::::In a separate action Tuesday, the Republican National Committee requested from the State Department copies of the documents signed when Clinton left office asserting she handed over all official communications. The committee also sought records related to the configuration, vetting and encryption of Clinton’s personal BlackBerry.::::::::“Hillary Clinton clearly violated the spirit of the ‘Separation Statement’ that she compelled all other Department personnel to sign,” committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “While the State Department has failed to answer whether she signed the agreement herself, it cannot ignore a request under the Freedom of Information Act.”::::::::During the closed-door meeting of Republicans, Boehner emphasized that Chaffetz and Gowdy weren’t leading a “witch hunt,” Representative Dave Schweikert of Arizona said.::::::::Schweikert and Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico said Boehner offered no schedule for potential subpoenas.::::::::“Boehner said we are just looking for the truth,” Pearce said.::::::::The speaker said the investigating work of the committees is unchanged and both will pursue gaining access to the documents.::::::::“We have rigorous oversight activities at both the Benghazi committee and at the Government Reform Committee, and I don’t think there’s any changes that need to be made,” Boehner said.::::::::Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, top Democrat on the Oversight and Benghazi committees, said in an interview Monday that he didn’t know what the Republican lawmakers plan to do. He said Gowdy probably will focus on Benghazi and “Chaffetz will deal with a much broader field -- the server and all of that.”::::::::“I think it’s overkill,” Cummings said. “I think it’s unprecedented.”::::::::Cummings said that in 2007, when Democrats controlled the House, they sought documents related the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys while Republican George W. Bush was president. In the probe, he said they learned some e-mails were sent using a server run by the Republican National Committee, not from a government computer.::::::::Instead of issuing a subpoena, Cummings said the former Oversight Committee chairman, Henry Waxman of California, negotiated with Republican National Committee lawyers.::::::::“I think that this is an appropriate way to try to address that, if it’s going to be addressed,” Cummings said.::::::::Cyber security experts say that it’s possible even deleted messages could be recovered. Standard deletion would likely leave most or all of the contents stored somewhere on the computer system, allowing recovery with forensic tools, Ken Westin of Tripwire said in an e-mail. There might also backup copies somewhere, he said.::::::::“If she just deleted them, they will probably still be present and recoverable,” said Eric Fiterman, a former FBI agent and cybersecurity expert. “But if she hired someone who specializes in data recovery and forensics to make data disappear, then odds of recovery are low.”::::::::And recovery can only happen if a forensic expert can gain the authority to try and recover the data. With Clinton objecting, Congress or the courts would need to try and force that action.::::::::Given these files were created while Clinton was the nation’s top diplomat, “there are all kinds of legislative purposes they could come up with to go after them,” said Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York, who studies constitutional law and legislative procedure. “There’s no reason why the House can’t subpoena a former official for records that are in her possession.”::::::::Still, without any details of what kinds of information are on that computer, a subpoena for the server or an image of its contents, would be a venture into uncharted waters, said Peter Shane, a law professor at The Ohio State University, who has written about the separation of powers.::::::::“This would be absolutely new territory,” he said. “Asking for her server is like asking for her file cabinet.”::::::::Whatever the legal arguments, Shane and other experts expect the final resolution to come down to a negotiation between Republican lawmakers and Clinton, each driven by their political calculations. Clinton won’t want to seem to be keeping secrets, and lawmakers won’t want to seem to be bullying her, he said: “Both sides have a political problem.”::::::::To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Drajem in Washington at mdrajem@bloomberg.net; Billy House in Washington at bhouse5@bloomberg.net::::::::To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net Steve Geimann"
"34438"	"2015-03-17"	"PolitiFact on Hillary Clinton's email: Did she follow all the rules?"	"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raises her glass during a toast Monday at a ceremony to induct her into the Irish America Hall of Fame in New York City. [Getty Images]::::::::Throughout the controversy regarding her exclusive use of private email while secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has said she followed the rules. But the truth isn't so clear cut.::::::::Although some former secretaries of state occasionally used personal emails for official business, Clinton is the only one who never once used an @state.gov email address in the era of email. Some have questioned whether that practice violated rules regulating email use, transparency, records management or security.::::::::At a news conference last week, Clinton said, ""I fully complied with every rule I was governed by.""::::::::Let's cut to the chase: We interviewed several experts on government transparency and records preservation. While Clinton might be able to put together a case that she ""complied"" with the rules, experts said her actions are nevertheless hard to defend.::::::::We decided not to put Clinton's claim on the Truth-O-Meter, because there are a lot of unknowns. But we still wanted to bring out as many facts as possible.::::::::""While Clinton may have technical arguments for why she complied with each of these and the other rules that have been discussed in the news, the argument that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law is unsustainable,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation.::::::::We sent multiple requests for comment to Clinton's staff, but they didn't get back to us for this story.::::::::There was not an explicit, categorical prohibition against federal employees using personal emails when Clinton was in office, said Daniel Metcalfe, former director of the Department of Justice's Office of Information Policy, where he administered implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. High-level officials like Clinton need the flexibility to sometimes use a personal email, such as responding to a national security emergency in the middle of the night.::::::::So it seems she didn't break a rule simply by using a personal email to conduct business. Rather, by using personal emails exclusively, she skirted the rules governing federal records management, Cox said.::::::::A federal record is any documentary material, regardless of physical form, made or received by a government agency, according to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which oversees federal recordkeeping. Records are preserved as evidence of the agencies' activities, decisions and procedures. Each agency is responsible for maintaining its records in accordance with regulations.::::::::It would have been a violation of the NARA's rules in the Code of Federal Regulations for Clinton to use personal email exclusively, Metcalfe said. The code requires federal agencies to make and preserve records that duly document agency activity, so that they are readily available when needed — such as for FOIA requests or congressional inquiries. Using personal email exclusively is contrary to proper record preservation.::::::::""Anyone at NARA would have said you can't use a personal email account for all of your official business,"" said Metcalfe, who held his position in part during former President Bill Clinton's administration.::::::::Had Clinton used an @state.gov email address, every email sent and received would have been archived in the State Department system. Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, has argued that her emails were archived in the system because she was in the habit of sending them to other government employees with .gov email addresses.::::::::However, experts said this defense is insufficient. Under this practice, the State Department records management system would have captured emails from Clinton to a State Department employee, but it would not necessarily capture emails from Clinton to government employees in other departments or non-government employees, said John Wonderlich, policy director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for government transparency.::::::::Although they may contain the same individual emails, Clinton's outbox and other employees' inboxes are considered two separate records, which is important for locating the records in response to specific requests.::::::::For example, even if Clinton had sent every email to individuals with state.gov or other federal agency addresses, that procedure would hamper State Department compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests for Clinton's emails, said David Sobel, who directs a FOIA project at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital freedom advocacy group. It would not be apparent to agency personnel conducting the search that they would need to search the accounts of myriad employees to locate all of Clinton's emails, he said.::::::::""In fact, State likely would have argued that it would be unreasonable to conduct such a far-reaching search,"" Sobel said.::::::::In 2013, Gawker filed a FOIA request to the State Department for emails between Clinton and long-time adviser Sid Blumenthal after a hacker had revealed emails that Blumenthal sent Clinton. Although the emails were already known to the public, the State Department told Gawker that no such correspondence existed. Gawker believes this shows that Clinton was able to use her personal email to thwart the FOIA process.::::::::""Using a personal email account exclusively is a potent prescription for flouting the Federal Records Act and circumventing the Freedom of Information Act,"" Metcalfe said. ""And there can be little doubt that Clinton knew this full well.""::::::::In response to a State Department request last year, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from her private email server, leaving out emails and documents that she said were of a personal nature, like wedding and funeral plans. She later said she deleted these personal emails.::::::::Cox said the fact that Clinton's staff — rather than a State Department federal records officer — chose which emails to destroy is ""honestly breathtaking."" Her private employees don't have the authority to decide what does or doesn't count as a federal record. Further, when she was making these choices, she was acting as a private citizen, not a government employee.::::::::In Clinton's defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account.::::::::Because these rules weren't in effect when Clinton was in office, ""she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,"" said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.::::::::""Unless she violated a rule dealing with the handling of classified or sensitive but unclassified information, I don't see how she violated any law or regulation,"" said Bass, who is now executive director of the Bauman Foundation. ""There may be a stronger argument about violating the spirit of the law, but that is a very vague area.""::::::::Whether or not Clinton's email address complied with security regulations is a harder question. Clinton argues that she never emailed classified information, instead using other secure methods of communication approved by the State Department.::::::::However, in 2005 (before Clinton took office), a State Department manual said information that is ""sensitive but unclassified"" — a broad category that covers anything from meeting schedules, to visa applications, to ordinary emails to other federal agencies — should be emailed through servers authorized by the department.::::::::We also don't know if the State Department had signed off on Clinton's private server or if the server met government security standards, though the State Department was aware of the server. At the news conference, Clinton said the server was set up for former President Bill Clinton's office and that it had ""numerous safeguards.""::::::::The State Department has said there is no indication her account was breached.::::::::""Her assurance that there was no security breach is an empty assurance, because there's no way to know that for sure,"" Wonderlich said.::::::::Clinton's exclusive use of private email makes it difficult to know with certainty whether she complied with rules governing transparency, recordkeeping and security. We may never know what emails she deleted. Additionally, we may never know the details of her conversations with the State Department officials who briefed her on records management and security, and why they agreed to let her use a private email exclusively.::::::::Metcalfe pointed to Clinton's use of the word ""allowed"" and ""opted"" throughout her news conference, when referring to her decision to use private email. He said both words give the false impression that the law and its proper implementation presented her with a choice. She might have been ""allowed"" to use only a private email account in that no one stopped her, Metcalfe said, but that's not the same thing as lawfully complying with rules."

Politico reports it obtained the letter Wednesday. ""NARA is concerned that federal records may have been alienated from the Department of State’s official recordkeeping systems,"" Wester wrote to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Margaret Grafeld.""If federal records have been alienated, please describe all measures the department has taken, or expects to take, to retrieve the alienated records.

On Thursday, addressing a room of happy campers, she was all sunshine.::::::::A newly relaxed, approachable, and somewhat amusing Clinton was on full display Thursday at the American Camp Association’s Tri-State Conference in Atlantic City, where she gave what could be her last paid speech before launching a presidential campaign.::::::::And first policy prescription for the room full of happy campers, before a veiled shot at the current Democratic president? Have more fun.::::::::“As I have gotten older, I have decided we really need camps for adults,” she said. “We need the kind of camps that you all run, none of the serious stuff, none of the, you know, life challenge stuff, more fun. I think we have a huge fun deficit in America.”::::::::She would know. The last time we saw the former secretary of state, she not was having fun. She was on the defensive in front of a horde of reporters asking about her use of personal email when she was at the State Department.::::::::Not here, though, in an environment she completely controlled. She was relaxed and polished. You could see why she’s been making money hand over fist with these speeches over the last few years.::::::::On its face, the expo center was an odd venue, filled with adventure vendors selling everything from camping gear to bedbug remedies. The usual speakers at the annual conference, attendees said, were child development experts and players in the camping industry.::::::::The sole booth with any political reference was HollyRock Entertainment, where a giant Bill Clinton head sat on display. (The vendor assured The Daily Beast that the Hillary head was commissioned and would be ready when she hits the campaign trail.)::::::::But in many ways it was the perfect conditions for Clinton: a speech, softball Q&A with a political ally, and the press clustered off in the back of the room.::::::::Her campy (sorry) but self-deprecating humor (“When I was growing up, back in the Middle Ages!”) landed just right with a crowd accustomed to name games and trust falls.::::::::And even though many of the attendees weren’t sure why Clinton was there, they were happy to have her.::::::::But to be fair, the nearly 3,000 attendees seemed like a group of naturally upbeat and enthusiastic people. Not a lot of those on the campaign trail.::::::::As three giant, glowing bamboo-shaped lights softly changed colors around the stage, Clinton wove in and out of stories about her daughter, Chelsea, at camp as a child, into some light political fare like the importance of a clean environment and universal pre-kindergarten. She name-checked New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, an old political ally who hails from the left wing of her party, on the last point.::::::::But the real fun began when she started talking about the political environment in Washington. Using camp metaphors, of course.::::::::“The red cabin and the blue cabin have to come together and actually listen to each other. Wouldn’t that be a novel idea?” she said. “Sort of create this much more open dialogue opportunity which I would like to see more of in this country.”::::::::Later she stressed the importance of building relationships with the other side of the political aisle.::::::::“I don’t think there is any substitute for building relationships, I just don’t,” she said.::::::::Left unspoken was how the head counselor of the blue cabin has been routinely criticized for failing to forge a bond with the campers in the red cabin.::::::::She also painted a rosy picture of Bill Clinton’s relationship with Newt Gingrich when the latter was House speaker, saying Gingrich would come over to the White House to hash out policies out with the president after he was done trashing them in public. They got stuff done. Politics, she stressed, is for people who know how to talk and compromise, and the red cabin talked to the blue cabin when the Clintons were in charge.::::::::“Newt Gingrich would get up and say the worst thing about Bill and sometimes me during the day, and then he’d kind of come over to the White House and go up to the second floor, and they’d try to work out what they could do on everything from welfare reform to balancing the budget to dealing with the Mexican financial crisis, you name it,” she said.::::::::“The artifice, the kind of public persona was shelved, and people actually talked about what they needed to accomplish,” she said. “There is no substitute for that.”"

Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images | Bloomberg via Getty Images::::::::NEW YORK -- White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest recently shot down a New York Post report claiming that senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett orchestrated a leak to reveal that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had used a private email address for government business.::::::::Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks, had already said shortly after The New York Times broke the story about Clinton's emails that his committee wasn’t the source.::::::::So where did the story come from?::::::::Political scandals always breed speculation about motives, and the Clinton email story is no exception. Did Republican operatives ring the Times in order to tarnish the 2016 Democratic frontrunner? Or, perhaps, could a rival within Clinton's own party have provided the information? Or might the Clintons have leaked the story themselves to get a potentially damaging story out of the way more than 20 months before Election Day?:::::::::::::::: Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who broke the story on March 2, understandably won’t reveal his sources. But Schmidt's description of events to The Huffington Post suggests the story, which ultimately became a bombshell, wasn't billed to him as a scandal in the making or even as especially urgent. Indeed, Schmidt left for vacation the day after getting the original tip.::::::::“It was curious and it was interesting,"" Schmidt said, ""but it didn’t seem like it was going to be some type of major story.""::::::::Schmidt, 31, primarily reports on the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security for the Times. While covering a Saturday national security shift in the paper's Washington bureau in November 2014, Schmidt was assigned to write on a House Intelligence Committee report that found no evidence to support long-running allegations about the Obama administration’s handling of the Benghazi attacks. Since then, Schmidt has had the Gowdy-led House Select Committee on Benghazi in his portfolio as a micro-beat.::::::::In mid-February, Schmidt got a tip that the State Department had turned over Benghazi-related emails, sent from Clinton's personal account, to the committee.::::::::This cache, it would later be revealed, included 900 emails. But it still wasn't clear to Schmidt that Clinton had never had a State Department email and had conducted government business exclusively on the private account during her four-year tenure -- a practice that could impede records requests from congressional committees and journalists.::::::::The next day, Schmidt headed off to Florida on vacation for five days, and, upon his return, was assigned to follow Defense Secretary Ash Carter to Afghanistan and Kuwait. When he returned to Washington, by his account, he slept for a full day before finally getting to dig into the Clinton email story on Friday, Feb. 27.::::::::In hindsight, Schmidt said, “it’s a good lesson in that whenever you have a tip, you should run it into the ground as fast as possible.”::::::::That morning, he quickly learned from sources that Clinton had handed over 50,000 pages of emails -– around 30,000 emails in total -- to the State Department. Schmidt contacted the department to inquire why it hadn't already had possession of the emails, and continued to report what he now realized was a much bigger story than he had previously assumed.::::::::A State Department spokesman declined to comment for this story.::::::::Schmidt said that through the weekend, Times Washington Bureau Chief Carolyn Ryan kept pushing him to get more details, which he did. However, Schmidt did leave his apartment for a few hours Saturday evening, donning a tuxedo to cover a wedding for the Times, an assignment that predated the Clinton email story.::::::::After a few more days of reporting, Schmidt determined that Clinton had not, in fact, ever used a State Department email address. The Times published his story on the night of Monday, March 2, with the piece landing at the top of the next morning's front page.::::::::The following Sunday, on “Meet the Press,” Gowdy credited the Times with uncovering information that his committee hadn't. Jamal Ware, a spokesman for the Benghazi committee, clarified in a later email to HuffPost that Gowdy's comments referred to how Clinton had ""retained control of the emails and State had to be asked for them back,"" adding that ""State did not inform the committee of that before the NYT report.""::::::::State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach told HuffPost that the email issue was discussed in a previously scheduled Feb. 27 meeting with staffers from the Benghazi committee.::::::::The Times faced intense criticism from Clinton allies in the days that followed. Public Editor Margaret Sullivan addressed the complaints, but ultimately found the story to be accurate. And the Clinton email story hasn’t gone away: Gowdy requested on Thursday that Clinton turn over her private email server to his committee.::::::::Schmidt is no stranger to media controversies, having reported in 2009 about several baseball stars testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. His stories prompted the Major League Baseball Players Association to claim The New York Times had broken the law.::::::::Still, Schmidt said the media’s sustained interest in the Clinton email story “is far higher than any other story I’ve ever written.”"

"36520"	"2015-03-31"	"Head of Benghazi Panel Wants to Question Hillary Clinton Privately on Email Use"	"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House select committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.::::::::“The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,” the chairman, Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said in a letter sent Tuesday morning.::::::::Mr. Gowdy said that the committee believed Mrs. Clinton’s “email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented.” He said that her decision to delete all of her emails amid the congressional investigation into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, “only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it, and why she did it.”::::::::In a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said that an examination of the server that housed Mrs. Clinton’s email account showed it had no copies of emails she sent during her time in office.::::::::The lawyer, David Kendall, said that in response to a request from the State Department in October, Mrs. Clinton’s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private. Then, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months, he said. The setting was changed after Mrs. Clinton provided the State Department in December with roughly 30,000 printed emails that her representatives said were government records, he said.::::::::Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails, which were housed on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.::::::::At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Times’s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she “chose not to keep” her private personal emails. But she then also said that the server, which also contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “will remain private.”::::::::Meanwhile, some Republicans on Capitol Hill — including Mr. Gowdy — are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue. On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clinton’s decision to delete her emails “is criminal in nature.”::::::::“I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox and Friends.”::::::::“Even Nixon didn’t destroy the tapes,” Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation. “There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.”::::::::Mr. Gowdy believes that such attacks could make it appear as though the Republican-led committee is out to embarrass Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat who is expected to announce in April that she is running for president.::::::::“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus. “And I’m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.”::::::::“We don’t know enough facts, so why speculate?” Mr. Gowdy added. “We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.”"
"36536"	"2015-03-31"	"Source: Clinton used iPad, multiple devices for personal email at State"	"Clinton used an iPad and a Blackberry for email, the source said Tuesday, confirming an Associated Press report that Clinton emailed with staff about both work and personal issues on her iPad.::::::::Clinton's exclusive use of a personal email account and server while at State has grown into a controversy that has defined the run up to Clinton's expected April presidential announcement. In a press conference at the United Nations earlier this month, Clinton explained that she used a personal email because she only wanted to have one phone, not two.::::::::""When I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department,"" Clinton said, ""because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.""::::::::She added: ""Looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.""::::::::That clearly changed, however, once the Apple released the iPad in 2010, a year after Clinton took over at State.::::::::Republicans pounced on the AP revelation on Tuesday. The RNC blasted the story to reporters, arguing it that Clinton ""was not being truthful when she claimed to have built her secret server for the 'convenience' of using one device.""::::::::A source close to Clinton, however, argued on Tuesday that ""the AP reporting on her iPad use later on during her time at State does not contradict her UN comments at all.""::::::::""She said her reason for opting for one email account in 2009 was a desire to not have to carry more than one device around,"" the source said. ""And in the second sentence of the above statement, she specifies that the extra device she was seeking to avoid was 'a second phone.'""::::::::The AP released four emails from Clinton that were unclassified by the U.S. Department of State. Among those emails were an exchange between Clinton and Huma Abedin, her longtime aide and confidant, that blended work and personal topics.::::::::On September 18, 2011, Abedin forwarded Clinton an AP story about a drone crash along the Afghan border. Inadvertently, Clinton responded with an email about decorations.::::::::""I like the idea of these,"" Clinton wrote. ""How high are they? What would the bench be made of? And I'd prefer two shelves or attractive boxes/baskets/containers [sic] on one. What do you think?""::::::::Abdein responded asking, ""Did u mean to send to me?""::::::::""No - sorry!,"" Clinton wrote back. ""Also, pls let me know if you got a reply from my ipad. I'm not sure replies go thru.""::::::::The exchange was part of the over 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department in December. Clinton has asked that those roughly 30,000 emails be released to the public. State Department officials have said they will release them after they have been reviewed, a process that could take months.::::::::During her United Nations press conference, Clinton argued that her team went ""above and beyond"" in providing the State Department with any emails related to work. The exchange with Abdein appears to buttress that defense -- the email included personal exchanges but Clinton's team turned it over to State anyway because it also addressed a work issue.::::::::Other emails in the AP release include Clinton emailing with top aides about a CNN story on Obama administration national security. ""I think this is both dishonorable and dangerous and want to find way to say it,"" Clinton wrote in response to the piece.::::::::Clinton's iPad revelation comes the same day that Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, sent a letter to Clinton's lawyer requesting that the former secretary of state appear before the panel for a transcribed interview on her email usage.::::::::""This Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,"" Gowdy said in a letter to David E. Kendall. ""The Committee is willing to schedule the interview at a time convenient for Secretary Clinton, but no later than May 1, 2015.""::::::::Gowdy also said that if Clinton ""continues to reject the offer of a neutral review, the House of Representatives as a whole will need to consider its next steps.""::::::::The chairman subpoenaed Clinton's emails regarding Libya and, last month, the State Department turned over about 300 emails to the committee.::::::::Gowdy said in his letter that once there is a ""reasonable assurance"" that Clinton had control of her documents, the panel could ""schedule her appearance in a public hearing to constructively discuss these topics."""

The request also asked for certain emails about government programs to eavesdrop on terror suspects believed to be foreigners.::::::::Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said the low number of emails provided to AP could be because the State Department uses different words to describe its operations — such as ""UAV,"" or unmanned aerial vehicle, instead of ""drone.""::::::::It's also possible that Clinton and her advisers' emails are not in the department's archives, he said.::::::::""If there are four, one would expect there to be quite a few more than that,"" Aftergood said.

She seeks advice on how best to condemn information leaks, and accidentally replies to one work email with questions apparently about decorations.::::::::The messages also reveal Clinton used an iPad to email while secretary of state in addition to her BlackBerry, despite her explanation she set up a private email account and homebrew server while she was the nation's top diplomat so that she could carry a single device.::::::::The four emails were obtained by The Associated Press under a 2013 Freedom of Information Act request and offer one of the first looks into Clinton's correspondence at the State Department. It is the first time it has provided Clinton-related documents in response to several outstanding FOIA requests, the first of which AP filed in 2010.::::::::The response also came about three weeks after AP filed a federal lawsuit against the State Department, seeking to force the release of materials during Clinton's tenure.::::::::Clinton is widely expected to announce her candidacy for president next month, and will enter the race as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.::::::::The 2013 request sought correspondence between Clinton and her advisers over a four-year period that contained keywords such as ""drone,"" ''metadata"" and ""prism."" The latter was among several code words for controversial U.S. surveillance programs revealed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.::::::::Although Clinton left office four months before the Snowden leaks were first published in June 2013, the AP's request sought messages about those programs before they were publicly disclosed. The request also asked for certain emails about government programs to eavesdrop on terror suspects believed to be foreigners.::::::::Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said the low number of emails provided to AP could be because the State Department uses different words to describe its operations - such as ""UAV,"" or unmanned aerial vehicle, instead of ""drone.""::::::::It's also possible that Clinton and her advisers' emails are not in the department's archives, he said.::::::::""If there are four, one would expect there to be quite a few more than that,"" Aftergood said. ""And it looks like another indication of faulty records management and retrieval at the State Department.""::::::::Clinton has said she exchanged about 60,000 emails while secretary of state, about half of which were work-related. She said none contained classified information, and that her private email system did not suffer any security breaches.::::::::The highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email server gave Clinton complete control over access to her message archives. She deleted emails - some 30,000 in total - she described as personal in nature, and has declined the request of Republicans that she turn over her server for an independent review.::::::::Among the four emails obtained by AP is one in which Clinton accidentally mingled personal and work matters. In reply to a message sent in September 2011 by adviser Huma Abedin to Clinton's personal email account, which contained an AP story about a drone strike in Pakistan, Clinton mistakenly replied with questions that appear to be about decorations.::::::::""I like the idea of these,"" she wrote to Abedin. ""How high are they? What would the bench be made of? And I'd prefer two shelves or attractive boxes/baskets/ containers (sic) on one. What do you think?""::::::::Abedin replied, ""Did u mean to send to me?"" To which Clinton wrote, ""No-sorry! Also, pls let me know if you got a reply from my ipad. I'm not sure replies go thru.""::::::::Earlier this month, Clinton said she chose a personal account over a government one out of convenience, describing it as a way to carry a single device, rather than a State Department-issued BlackBerry for work emails and a second device for personal messages.::::::::""Looking back, it would have been probably, you know, smarter to have used two devices,"" Clinton said. Her spokesman, Nick Merrill, said Tuesday that the secretary used her iPad from time to time, primarily to read news clippings.::::::::Also Tuesday, Republican South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of a House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, said he wants to interview Clinton by May 1.::::::::Gowdy said the recorded interview would help the committee better understand decisions she made related to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records - namely her emails.::::::::Merrill said Tuesday that Clinton told Gowdy's committee months ago that she was ready to appear at a public hearing.::::::::Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Matthew Daly contributed to this report."
"38430"	"2015-04-06"	"Hillary's Right to Privacy: Another Needed Debate About Clinton's Backchannel Emails"	"With the 2016 presidential race off and running, the growing controversy over Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton's prohibited use of a private email account and server to conduct her official business as Secretary of State is certainly not going away soon.:::::::::::::::: Initially, the controversy centered around whether Clinton set up the account and intentionally violated the Federal Records Act, and even committed a felony in doing so. The law requires federal officials using private email to conduct their business to copy and turn over such correspondence to the National Archives within 20 days.:::::::::::::::: Writing in National Review, Shannon Coffin said,:::::::::::::::: While at that point, the controversy centered on the intent and legality of her use of the account. It could have evolved into a debate about the need and overreaching of the Federal Records Act and a much needed discussion about how the evolution of sunshine laws and obsessive recordkeeping of communications stymies the conduct of good government.::::::::But then came the revelation by her attorney to Congress that there were ""no copies"" of the emails she sent while Secretary of State, and she later told reporters that she ""chose not to keep"" her private personal emails.::::::::In other words, Clinton wiped out the entire contents of the email account, which in terms of more primordial communications sent up more red flags ala Richard Nixon's erasing of the White House tapes.:::::::::::::::: So now that Clinton obviously obstructed the inquiry over her use of personal emails by eliminating them (although they are still floating around out there in cyberspace), more questions about how much Clinton really knew about events and deaths of American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya are reappearing.:::::::::::::::: Now Clinton has been asked to appear, in private, for an interview with the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, which surely continues Clinton down the road of controversy toward calls for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate both her behavior as Secretary of State and her email deletions.:::::::::::::::: Public officials, whether they be Hillary Clinton or the local dog catcher, should be able to conduct their official business within a framework that allows for some private discussion and communications, and the lack of record-keeping too.:::::::::::::::: Like any interaction between fellow individuals, whether it be at work, in a social setting, or at home, there's a place for private talk, correspondence -- and acrimony too -- which in turn makes for better learning and understanding without the constraints of public oversight.:::::::::::::::: In my personal experience as a county legislator, one of the biggest problems for the Board was the inability to meet as a group in private to hash out differences and have conversations free of the press and the public hanging on every word.:::::::::::::::: The vaunted quest for open government, and the related goal of preserving all interactions by our public officials, stymies free and thoughtful conduct of our governments as much as it prevents shady private dealings and corrupt activities. There needs to be more common sense applied in how we constrain our public officials.:::::::::::::::: It's a shame that the fight now is going to center around Clinton's questionable actions to continue to thwart the legal review of her thoughts and actions rather than to debate her right to backchannel as a part of her job as Secretary of State.:::::::::::::::: Madam Secretary Clinton, as our chief diplomat, should have had the unfettered right to conduct a conversation, either written or oral, particularly in diplomatic circles where secrets are essential to formulate good and lasting policies that can affect our nation for decades.:::::::::::::::: But the way things stand, the debate over whether Clinton committed a felony a number of times will prevail, particularly as this email controversy knocks her out of an uncontested road to the Democratic nomination.::::::::Steven Kurlander blogs at Kurly's Kommentary (stevenkurlander.com) and writes for Context Florida and The Huffington Post and can be found on Twitter @Kurlykomments.

In the meantime, a number of new Republican challengers have begun to edge ahead of her in key swing states, the poll says – a fact that could accelerate her campaign announcement.::::::::The poll, released Thursday, shows Mrs. Clinton falling narrowly behind Sen. Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky in Iowa, and by three points in Colorado. She is effectively tied with every Republican candidate in Colorado, according to the poll, and has a narrow lead over most GOP candidates in Iowa, with the exception of Senator Paul.::::::::Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement that the results are ""a boost"" for Paul, who officially launched his 2016 presidential campaign earlier this week.::::::::The one positive in the poll for Clinton is that she leads all Republican candidates in Virginia – the largest of the three swing states polled – including a four point lead over Paul.::::::::But it's still early in the 2016 presidential cycle and polls are often volatile. In March 2014, Clinton led Paul by 10 points in a hypothetical Hawkeye State matchup, according to a Quinnipiac poll. At that time, her lead against other GOP prospects in Iowa was even stronger: Clinton was up 16 points against Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, 14 points against former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, and 13 points against Gov.

Other GOP contenders are expected to include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, as well as Governors Christie, Bush, and Huckabee.::::::::The majority of respondents in each of the three swing states said they do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, though a majority of respondents said they think she has strong leadership qualities, and that they approved of the way she handled her job as secretary of State.::::::::""It is difficult to see Secretary Clinton's slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail,"" said Brown. ""Voters do think she is a strong leader – a key metric – but unless she can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems.""::::::::Just a few months ago, it appeared that Clinton was in no rush to formally announce her campaign, happy instead to stay on the sidelines raising money.
