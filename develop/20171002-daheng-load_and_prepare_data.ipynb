      "2014-11-18 00:03:28\tTimes of India\tIndia sixth worst affected country by terrorism in 2013: Report\tLONDON: India was the sixth worst affected country by terrorism in 2013 — the other five being war zones at present. :::::::::::::::: As many as 43 different terrorist groups categorized into three groups: Islamists, separatists and communists have been found to have planned and carried out attacks in India. :::::::::::::::: The world witnessed 10,000 terrorist attacks in 2013, a 44% increase from the previous year. India, however, witnessed a much higher increase of terrorist attacks during the same period — while terrorism increased by 70% in India from 2012 to 2013, the number of deaths increased from 238 to 404. :::::::::::::::: Globally, the number of deaths from terrorism increased by 61%, according to the Global Terrorism Index 2014. :::::::::::::::: The report says that in India, there remains significant terrorist activity, including on the border between India and Pakistan. :::::::::::::::: Over 80% of the deaths from terrorist incidents in 2013 were recorded in just five countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. :::::::::::::::: On a scale of 1 (lowest impact of terrorism) to 10 (highest risk of terrorism) — Iraq which has emerged as the world's worst affected country with terrorism is the only entry with a score of 10. :::::::::::::::: India which is ranked sixth has a score of 7.86. :::::::::::::::: The largest year-on-year increase in deaths from terrorism was recorded between 2012 and 2013 increasing from 11,133 to 17,958. :::::::::::::::: As many as 87 countries experienced a terrorist incident in 2013, slightly up from 81 in 2012. :::::::::::::::: The number of countries experiencing over 50 deaths in one year hit an all-time high in 2013 at 24, five greater than the previous high of 19 countries in 2008. :::::::::::::::: The Global Index said about India — \"The number of attacks also increased, with 55 more attacks in 2013 than 2012. However, the majority of terrorist attacks in India have low casualties. In 2013 around 70% of attacks were non-lethal. Communist terrorist groups are by far the most frequent perpetrators and the main cause of deaths in India. Three Maoist communist groups claimed responsibility for 192 deaths in 2013, which was nearly half of all deaths from terrorism in India. Police are overwhelmingly the biggest targets of Maoists, accounting for half of all deaths and injuries. This is mainly through armed assaults, which killed 85, and bombings and explosions, which killed 43\". :::::::::::::::: The dispute with Pakistan over Jammu & Kashmir is the source of Islamic terrorism in India, according to the report. In 2013, three Islamist groups were responsible for around 15% of deaths in India. This includes Hizbul Mujahideen which was the only group in India to use suicide tactics in 2013. :::::::::::::::: \"Islamist groups in India commonly use armed assaults targeting the police or bombings targeting private citizens. The majority of attacks occur in Hyderabad and Jammu & Kashmir. In September 2014, al-Qaida announced its presence in India, hoping to unite other Islamist groups,\" the report says. :::::::::::::::: Globally, four terrorist groups — al-Qaida, Boko Haram, IS and the Taliban were responsible for 66% of all deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013 in which the perpetrator is known. :::::::::::::::: Deaths from other groups operating in Pakistan, Syria, Somalia, India and Kenya, account for a further 21% of deaths in the same year. Prominent groups operating in these countries include the Al-Nusrah Front in Syria, Al-Shabaab in Somalia and Kenya, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in Pakistan and Maoists in India. :::::::::::::::: In total there have been over 48,000 terrorist incidents over the last 14 years claiming over 1,07,000 lives. Terrorism has increased dramatically with even conservative estimates suggesting a fivefold surge since the year 2000. :::::::::::::::: In 2013 alone, almost 10,000 terrorist incidents were recorded, resulting in approximately 18,000 deaths. The significant majority of these incidents, over 60%, occurred in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. The increase is due mainly to terrorist activity within these five countries. As a consequence, these countries have experienced a dramatic increase in the loss of life in 2013 with fatalities reaching 14,722 collectively. :::::::::::::::: Excluding these five countries in 2013, there were almost 4,000 attacks in the rest of the world killing 3,236 people. This represents an increase of 54% over the prior year. :::::::::::::::: Other than the five most affected countries, the trend over the last 14 years is upward with terrorist attacks substantially increasing by 180%. :::::::::::::::: Furthermore, terrorists are largely successful in carrying out their tactical objectives. :::::::::::::::: In 2013 the success rate was over 85%. The rise in terrorist activity coincided with the US invasion of Iraq. This created large power vacuums in the country allowing different factions to surface and become violent. :::::::::::::::: Steve Killelea, executive chairman of Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) said, \"Terrorism doesn't arise on its own; by identifying the factors associated with it, policies can be implemented to improve the underlying environment that nurtures terrorism. The most significant actions that can be taken are to reduce state-sponsored violence such as extra-judicial killings, reduce group grievances and hostilities, and improve effective and community-supported policing.\" :::::::::::::::: The report also sources both high and low estimates of foreign fighters who are actively fighting in Syria, utilizing the best available data. :::::::::::::::: The low estimations for number of fighters from Europe are 396, with the high estimates at 1,846. :::::::::::::::: The two most successful strategies for ending terrorist groups since the late 1960s have been either policing or the initiation of a political process; 80% of organizations that ceased operations ended this way. Only 10% of terrorist organizations ended due to having achieved their goals, while 7% were eliminated by full military engagement. :::::::::::::::: Terrorism in Pakistan meanwhile, has been found to be strongly influenced by its proximity to Afghanistan with most attacks occurring near the border involving the Taliban. Like in Afghanistan, terrorism increased significantly in Pakistan in 2013, with a 37% increase in deaths and 28% increase in injuries since 2012. Nearly half of all attacks had no groups that have claimed responsibility. The deadliest group in Pakistan in 2013, responsible for almost a quarter of all deaths and 49% of all claimed attacks, is Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban. :::::::::::::::: The report says that terrorism in Pakistan has a diverse array of actors. In 2013, there were 23 different terrorist groups, down from 29 groups in 2012. However, 11 groups account for the majority of the 270 claimed attacks. :::::::::::::::: Over 60% of fatalities in Pakistan were from bombings and explosions and around 26% from firearms. A quarter of targets and deaths were against private citizens, with police accounting for 20% of targets and deaths. The deadliest attacks were against religious figures and institutions which, on average, killed over five people and injured over 11 per attack. In 2013, there were 71 suicide attacks responsible for around 2,740 casualties. :::::::::::::::: More than 500 cities in Pakistan had at least one terrorist incident in 2013, with two or more incidents occurring in 180 cities. Of all attacks, 16% occurred in the largest city of Karachi. ::::::::::::::::The figures::::::::::::::::: * The number of lives lost to terrorist attacks increased by 61% in a single year rising from 11,133 in 2012 to 17,958 in 2013. :::::::::::::::: * There was a 44% increase in the number of terrorist incidents, rising from 6,825 in 2012 to 9,814 in 2013. :::::::::::::::: * Explosives accounted for the majority of these attacks, while suicide bombings accounted for less than 5%. :::::::::::::::: * Over 80% of the deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013 were in just five countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. :::::::::::::::: * Iraq continues to be the country most impacted by terrorism with 2,492 attacks killing 6,362 people, which represents a 164% increase from 2012. IS was responsible for most of the deaths in the country. :::::::::::::::: * In 2013, there were 3,721 attacks recorded in the rest of the world killing 3,236 people, an increase of over 50%. :::::::::::::::: * A total of 60 countries recorded deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013. :::::::::::::::: * Since 2000, around 7% of all terrorist incidents and 5% of all fatalities have occurred in OECD countries resulting in 4,861 deaths from 3,151 attacks. :::::::::::::::: * OECD-based terrorism in 2013 was slightly down from 130 deaths and 333 incidents in 2012 to 113 deaths and 311 incidents in 2013. :::::::::::::::: * There were almost 10,000 terrorist attacks recorded in 2013 representing a 44% increase on 2012, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths representing a 61% increase from the previous year. :::::::::::::::: * 24 countries experienced more than 50 deaths in 2013, increasing 60% from 15 in 2012. :::::::::::::::: * Terrorism in 2013 was dominated by four organizations — IS, Boko Haram, al-Qaida and the Taliban, collectively responsible for 66% of all fatalities.\r\n"
